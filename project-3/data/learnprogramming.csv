## Quick start:

1. New to programming? Not sure how to start learning? See [FAQ - Getting started][faq-start].
2. Have a question? Our [FAQ][faq] covers many common questions; check that first. Also try searching old posts, either [via google][google] or via reddit's search.
3. Your question isn't answered in the FAQ? Please read the following:

## Getting debugging help

If your question is about code, make sure it's **specific** and **provides all information up-front**. Here's a checklist of what to include:

1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].
2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.
4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that demonstrates your problem.
5. The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.

Do your best to solve your problem before posting. The quality of the answers will be proportional to the amount of effort you put into your post. Note that title-only posts are automatically removed.

Also see [our full posting guidelines][debugging] and the [subreddit rules][rules]. After you post a question, **DO NOT** delete it!

## Asking conceptual questions

Asking conceptual questions is ok, but please check [our FAQ][faq] and search older posts first.

If you plan on asking a question similar to one in the FAQ, explain what exactly the FAQ didn't address and clarify what you're looking for instead. See our full guidelines on [asking conceptual questions][conceptual] for more details.

## Subreddit rules

Please read [our rules][rules] and [other policies][policies] before posting. If you see somebody breaking a rule, report it! Reports and PMs to the mod team are the quickest ways to bring issues to our attention.

Git is what is known as an open-source version control system which means that it records files over a period of time and these changes can be recalled at a later date. You can do a lot with Git whether it can be branching (creating something that is different from the master branch (the one you would most likely be working on)) or just committing to a repository (programming jargon simply calls it a repo).

[What Is Git Article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) \- A more in-depth article concerning Git (Do not be alarmed at the fact it uses BitBucket)

&amp;#x200B;

**What Is GitHub?**

While there are multiple different cloud-based version control systems on the web, GitHub remains to be one of the most popular and it is free too! It can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Basic Setup**

Depending on what OS (operating system) you have the setup might be slightly different.

*Linux (Will specifically be on a Debian system ie Ubuntu)*

Go to your terminal and type these commands (keep in mind these will be using the root preference)

`sudo apt update` This will essentially update your system.

`sudo apt install git` This will install Git on the system.

`git --version` This is used to verify its downloaded.

*Mac*

Will also be in the terminal

`ruby -e ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)""`

`brew doctor` Will installs an application known as Homebrew which helps simplifies the installation of software on Mac systems.

`brew install git` Will install Git on your system

*Windows*

Navigate to Git-SCM: [Git SCM Download](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Git SCM will download protocol but also a BASH, a command line

(Sidenote: I would personally recommend learning the command line as it is a lot more powerful and if you understand the command line you would also understand the GUI. One GUI based version control systems is GitKraken)

&amp;#x200B;

**Basic/ Most Used Bash Commands (Keep in mind there are several modifiers for each command)**

`ls` \- lists the folders and files in the working directory (the current directory you are in)

`cd` \- changes directory

`pwd`\- used to find the path for the current directory

mkdir- make a directory

`touch` \- update the access and or modification date of a file or directory without opening, saving or closing the file.

`cat` \-  print files to stdout

`mv` \- moves files and folders

`cp` \- copies files or folders

`rm` \- remove files and folder (look into modifiers for this one)

`chmod` \- Change mode so you can set permissions for read, write and execute for the user, members of your group and others. (Binary can be used for this)

`man` \- can be used to look up any commands ie `man cd`

&amp;#x200B;

**Using GitBash/Terminal to Access GitHub**

1. Configure Git via `git config --global` `user.name` `""[name]""` and `git config --global` [`user.email`](https://user.email) `""[email address]""`
2. Navigate to your working directory (Keep in mind you cannot just cd to the directory, you have to work your way to it, so I personally keep a folder called Programming in my home directory)
3. Initialize a Git Repo via `git init`

Now, this is where you can branch-of, you have two options, pushing a new repo or pushing a preexistent repo.

*Pushing a New Repo*

1. Commit your repo via `git commit -m ""first commit""`
2. Remote add your repo via `git remote add origin &lt;url&gt;`
3. Push to your repo via `git push -u origin master`

*For Pushing an Existing Repo*

1. Remote add your repo via `git remote add origin &lt;url&gt;`
2. Push to your repo via `git push -u origin master`

Now that you have your repo set up, these are some helpful commands:

`git status` Used to check what has changed ie additions and deletions

`git add &lt;file&gt;` Used to add files to commit if used with a period (.) it adds all of the files

`git commit -m ""message""` Use to commit changed, but it is on the local system, the -m can be changed to things such as -u which is an update but it is recommended to keep with an -m

`git push` Used to push changes to GitHub

`git reset` Can be used after commit to reset the commits (Good if you accidentally add a file you did not want)

`git pull &lt;url&gt;` Can be used to pull from any git repo, leave the URL out if your updating your current repo

&amp;#x200B;

**.gitignore**

The .gitignore file is useful for stopping certain files from committing automatically. It should automatically be in a repo when you create a project. To use it just `cd` to the directory where the file you want to exclude is and use `pwd` to find the directory pathing. Then copy the path into the file, it should look like a text file, and then add the name of the file you want to exclude. 

Example: User/Jun/Programming/src/something.java

&amp;#x200B;

**Branching in Git (For advanced user)**

Branching is useful when many people are working on the same project or when you have multiple versions of the same project. The major advantage of branching is when you want to add a feature without compromising the integrity of the master branch. 

*Branching Commands*

`git branch [branch-name]` Used to create a new branch

`git checkout [branch-name]` Used to switch branches

`git merge [branch]` Used to merge branch commits (usually people use this with a branch and the master)

`git branch -d [branch-name]` Used to delete a branch

&amp;#x200B;

# Preamble 

Learning programming is hard. I did it in 6 months, yes. I managed to land a job, yes. Yet I have to tell you guys. This wasn't easy. This wasn't incredibly hard, but it wasn't easy. My post aims to make you understand what was hard, what made it easier, and help you make it even easier if you're trying to go down that road. I truly hope you can make it out. This world is savage, this community helped me, I want to help back.

I am a 29 yo French guy who spent the last 8 years working way more than he should have for employers that didn't reward any of my sacrifices. Earlier in 2019 I tried to start a gym but banks in France are VERY strict after 3 months of fighting I had to postpone this plan. Around April I was lost. I had no degree cos I dropped out of school, not enough funding to start my company and the industry in which I evolved for the past 8 years is toxic. At this point I start to mess around with Python until I started to truly learn web development in August. Since then, I got 2 job offers and accepted the best of the two (50k€ vs 46k€). This salary may seem high or low to you. It is in Paris so for a beginner, it is quite high. Let me walk you through how I did it. 

&amp;#x200B;

# The age problem

When I decided to learn programming, I was 28, now I am 29. As you see, it didn't take very long. If you know you like computer stuff and you're gifted of being a quick learner, you can land a job in less than a year! Moreover, your experience matters a LOT. I will be back on this later on but having professional experience (and more importantly social skills) is a HUGE gamechanger when you apply. Trust me, it's what got me several final offers.
Your age is not a problem. Just commit to it.

# Discipline

Discipline is extremly important. First, setting a routine helps. Even if you don't have any obligations, use an alarm and stick to it. Every day, wake up at the same hour, start your day with covfefe, shower and dress for outdoor activities with shoes even if you're gonna stay inside. You'll get a feeling that you have something to do and that will make you do it. **Do that only during the week days as the weekend is meant for resting.** Then, find ways to force yourself to study. For me, it was uninstalling a few games/apps and setting my learning material as my opening page on chrome. Also, a few extensions on chrome are great for pomodoro sessions that will block entertainment sites like facebook and twitter and all that you want to be blocked (ph?). Pomodoro comes from japan and is basically saying ""work for 25min straight then take a 5min break"". This is a great method when you're learning alone.

# Organization

Now this was something new for me. I've never liked to take notes. I've never really applied myself in my learning process. I knew I had to do something about it. Because programming is F. HARD. You are going to be smashed by hundreds of concepts per week. It's going to be hard, it's going to suck. So prepare yourself. You don't go to a marathon with jeans and business shoes? Well you don't start a life-changing decisions heavily relying on you learning things without methods to retain information.

From my experience the two best methods to retain information are:

* Taking paper notes. 
* Exercise. 

That's right. Taking paper notes, the old school way.  It's funny because I work on a computer, yet my brain retains more information when I write it with a pen. Maybe because it takes more time, which makes me think more about it, go figure. Anyways, this is what worked.

Exercising is not fun. I get you. But it works, so do it. It's just like strength training. Exercise, make gains.

# Research

The internet is FILLED with content. You can NOT not learn. If you want to learn something, there are at least 2 tutorials on udemy, 20 medium blog posts and 65 indian guy on YouTube who talked about it. Which is why, in my opinion, spending at least half a day finding the resource that you think is best for you is crucial before going into a very long and demanding bootcamp or class. You are going to spend weeks or months on that stuff, try spending at least half a day searching about it.

Pro tip from my experience for being a web developer:

[**FullStackOpen**](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

Extremely challenging course that I can only speak highly of. I started this course and learned SO MUCH not only about react/node but also writing tests, setting up a linter. **These things matters!!**

[**Freecodecamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

looks awesome I didn't follow it because I already had a few basics and wanted something more in-depth.

[**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Honestly if I didn't pick FullStackOpen I woulda chosen this one I think. The course looks thorough with tons of exercises.

[**The net ninja**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg)

He's been really helpful with what I consider some of the best frontend/design tutorials out there on YouTube

[**Traversy Media**](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)

Same as Shaun (net ninja) but has a high expertise in back-end development. Learned a lot from him on nodeJS and VueJS.

&amp;#x200B;

# What you should aim for to be hired as a junior developer.

**There are two areas EQUALLY IMPORTANT for you to be hired**

# Your developer skills

In my recent and fresh experience on the matter, I would recommend that you:

* Learn HTML and HTML semantic. It is important that you understand there is a main tag a section tag a wbr tag etc. putting divs and brs everywhere is considered bad practice and will put you in the ""just another junior dev"" bucket.
* Learn some CSS but more importantly learn how to master flexbox. You can learn css properties on the fly but learning CSS positioning will save you SO MUCH TIME. I strongly recommend [**flexbox zombies**](https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies) a very educative GAME
* Learn vanilla JS as well as web APIs such as fetch and the DOM. Learning React before having at least one very solid month (but I'd say two months) is gonna set you back. It did for me. I jumped onto react without knowing what the dom was and what JS was. It was a mistake. React uses a ""virtual"" DOM. If you don't even know what the DOM is, you're gonna be fucked.
* Learn a popular framework **IN YOUR AREA.** Paris is flooded with offers for React, this is why I learned React. If vue was trendy I would have learned Vue. It's all about maxing your chances to get hired. More job offers almost certainly means more employment so go for the trendy thing. Do your reseach on indeed or linkedin to see what developers are searched for.
* Do your best to write clean code. When you are going to work with colleagues, it's gonna be super important that they can go on your work and instantly understand what is happening. For that you can : Write documentation / Comment your code / Write tests that ensure your code doesnt bug and describes its behaviour / use a linter (like ESLINT) to make sure your code follows company standards (same spacing, etc)
* Learn how to use git with other people. I had the chance to practice with a friend for a few weeks which made me aware of several commands I NEVER USED alone. Things like rebase, using several branches etc. It's gonna matter a LOT for a company that you can use GIT properly so do it.

# Your interpersonal skills

It feels wrong having to explain this as I did 8 years in esports / marketing / sales before going into programming but this is such a big problem that I will actually detail how to be a good human being.

You will have an edge over other applicants if you specify that:

* You do not take critics against your code personally. Show that you have no wrong-placed ego.
* You can show your enthusiasm about technology, programming and the like. I always insisted on the fact that despite having worked in marketing, I've been building my own PCs since I was 12 and was actively interested in technology before. Also mention what you are learning right now. It shows you keep updated.
* When something feels off during a project, you are able to say it in a civilized way so that colleagues won't take that as you being arrogant or worse.... too timid to speak up.
* You are willing to learn AND share what you learned on your own to your team. Programming is hard and it's not just for you. Your team will love to learn new things that you stumbled upon.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final section : What I did. 

I learned python for 3 months and developped a discord bot. After that I realized it was really fun but who hires a clown making discord bots? After talking with friends who work in IT in Paris I realized web development is actively searched for and doesn't require high math knowledge like data science. It was decided. I was gonna learn web development. Having used the web for the past 18 years I was already accustomed to HTML and CSS but I went over the basics again. Then I jumped straight into React with fullstack open and despite it being a great course I got lost very quickly. It was hard man. I should have learned JS more in depth. Anyways I learned React and then did a few projects on my own as well as continuing learning more and more stuff. Instead of learning more languages I just learned more about the web. For example I learned about PWAs, I learned about more web APIs. This is what I did. Focusing on web development and having a few projects to show for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aaaand, that's it. I'm done typing. My final words:** 

It's gonna be hard, you're gonna think it's impossible, but you can do it. Wake up early, set up a routine, be organized and please ask me questions if you have any, here or in DM.",t2_n0qdx,False,,0,False,This community gave me a lot so I thought I would share how I find a job with 6 months of learning web development.,[],r/learnprogramming,False,6,,0,False,t3_evshoh,False,dark,,public,16,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,,1580337381.0,,[],{},,True,,1580357800.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnprogramming,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post incoming.

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been really helpful with what I consider some of the best frontend/design tutorials out there on YouTube&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traversy Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as Shaun (net ninja) but has a high expertise in back-end development. Learned a lot from him on nodeJS and VueJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What you should aim for to be hired as a junior developer.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two areas EQUALLY IMPORTANT for you to be hired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Your developer skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent and fresh experience on the matter, I would recommend that you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn HTML and HTML semantic. It is important that you understand there is a main tag a section tag a wbr tag etc. putting divs and brs everywhere is considered bad practice and will put you in the &amp;quot;just another junior dev&amp;quot; bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn some CSS but more importantly learn how to master flexbox. You can learn css properties on the fly but learning CSS positioning will save you SO MUCH TIME. I strongly recommend &lt;a href=""https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flexbox zombies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a very educative GAME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn vanilla JS as well as web APIs such as fetch and the DOM. Learning React before having at least one very solid month (but I&amp;#39;d say two months) is gonna set you back. It did for me. I jumped onto react without knowing what the dom was and what JS was. It was a mistake. React uses a &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; DOM. If you don&amp;#39;t even know what the DOM is, you&amp;#39;re gonna be fucked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a popular framework &lt;strong&gt;IN YOUR AREA.&lt;/strong&gt; Paris is flooded with offers for React, this is why I learned React. If vue was trendy I would have learned Vue. It&amp;#39;s all about maxing your chances to get hired. More job offers almost certainly means more employment so go for the trendy thing. Do your reseach on indeed or linkedin to see what developers are searched for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your best to write clean code. When you are going to work with colleagues, it&amp;#39;s gonna be super important that they can go on your work and instantly understand what is happening. For that you can : Write documentation / Comment your code / Write tests that ensure your code doesnt bug and describes its behaviour / use a linter (like ESLINT) to make sure your code follows company standards (same spacing, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to use git with other people. I had the chance to practice with a friend for a few weeks which made me aware of several commands I NEVER USED alone. Things like rebase, using several branches etc. It&amp;#39;s gonna matter a LOT for a company that you can use GIT properly so do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Your interpersonal skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels wrong having to explain this as I did 8 years in esports / marketing / sales before going into programming but this is such a big problem that I will actually detail how to be a good human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have an edge over other applicants if you specify that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not take critics against your code personally. Show that you have no wrong-placed ego.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can show your enthusiasm about technology, programming and the like. I always insisted on the fact that despite having worked in marketing, I&amp;#39;ve been building my own PCs since I was 12 and was actively interested in technology before. Also mention what you are learning right now. It shows you keep updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When something feels off during a project, you are able to say it in a civilized way so that colleagues won&amp;#39;t take that as you being arrogant or worse.... too timid to speak up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are willing to learn AND share what you learned on your own to your team. Programming is hard and it&amp;#39;s not just for you. Your team will love to learn new things that you stumbled upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final section : What I did.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned python for 3 months and developped a discord bot. After that I realized it was really fun but who hires a clown making discord bots? After talking with friends who work in IT in Paris I realized web development is actively searched for and doesn&amp;#39;t require high math knowledge like data science. It was decided. I was gonna learn web development. Having used the web for the past 18 years I was already accustomed to HTML and CSS but I went over the basics again. Then I jumped straight into React with fullstack open and despite it being a great course I got lost very quickly. It was hard man. I should have learned JS more in depth. Anyways I learned React and then did a few projects on my own as well as continuing learning more and more stuff. Instead of learning more languages I just learned more about the web. For example I learned about PWAs, I learned about more web APIs. This is what I did. Focusing on web development and having a few projects to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aaaand, that&amp;#39;s it. I&amp;#39;m done typing. My final words:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s gonna be hard, you&amp;#39;re gonna think it&amp;#39;s impossible, but you can do it. Wake up early, set up a routine, be organized and please ask me questions if you have any, here or in DM.&lt;/p&gt;

I've only been programming for about a year and two months total, and it really only started to sort of make sense with me after my first three months, so, in reality, I've only been ""programming"" for about 11 months. If you factor in how many times I gave up on programming in between, you're looking at only a total of maybe 7-8 months of actually diving into programming with interest. I look back at my perspective on programming as a middle schooler, high schooler, and university student, and for all of those 11 years, I'd either never really put much thought into programming or thought that it just looked like such a pain in the ass to learn because the syntax looked like the English language but was all just gibberish. ""I mean, in what way does `func (r *receiver) myMethod(xi ...int) (int, error)` look anything like plain English? Looks like a pain in the ass to learn."", is what I used to think.

Fast-forward to now, I can see how programming is very enjoyable and that the syntax *can* be read just like plain English. I regret judging programming in a negative way as a kid. I'm 27 years old now, and I'd often think, ""If I had started learning how to program in university, I would've had 9 years of experience. If I had started learning how to program in high school, I would've had 13 years of experience. If I had started learning how to program in junior high, I would've had 16 years of experience. But, due to my negligence and judgmental nature, I only have a year and two months under my belt. I regret everything.""

There's something about the programming/office workplace that just seems to be incompatible with me. Wondering if you other veterans have any advice.

I'm not incompetent or anything. I made my first website at age 13. I got a CS degree from a top 20 CS program in the US with a 3.9 GPA. I've had 4 different programming jobs now, as well as some time working as an independent contractor.

My current gig is by all measures the most flexible and balanced working situation yet. I have infinite sick days, a pretty strict 8 hours cutoff each day (including an hour+ for lunch), little to no expected OT, can work remotely as much as I want, a ton of autonomy.

And yet... I keep almost having panic attacks every time I try to code for the past couple years.

During all six of those years... I just felt disgusted by the nature of the work. Sitting at a desk staring at at abstract nonsense on a screen for 8 hours a day just feels profoundly inhuman. There's something that feels very wrong with this.

We keep programming more and more tools to automate more and more challenges out of day to day living. But I can't shake the feeling that we're programming the living out of life.

12,,learnprogramming,"I'm trying to write a Hangman game solver in Node.js.

I have already created a command line-based Hangman game that uses Node's `readline` module to prompt a user for an input. You can check out the source code and play the game here:

[https://repl.it/repls/MessyRashDesigns](https://repl.it/repls/MessyRashDesigns)

My plan is to make a Hangman solver that is essentially a parent Node app that runs the Hangman game as a child Node app within it. Then it communicates with the Hangman game, sending inputs until the game is over.

Now I'm having trouble with the communication part. You can see the source code for it the solver here (it includes the game so you can also try running it):

[https://repl.it/repls/TinyWellgroomedModes](https://repl.it/repls/TinyWellgroomedModes)

All of the current solver code is within `index.js`. I create a new instance of the game with `child_process`'s `spawn` function, and then use an event listener to read the game outputs. I try to write to the game with...

```javascript
child.stdin.write('t')
```

...but nothing happens. I'm stuck here now so I need help on how to proceed.

I originally wanted to try to only use native Node modules, but at this point I might be open to some 3rd party modules although a solution using only native Node modules would be nice.

Also I realize that I may not have a very good understanding on Node streams or streams in general for that matter. Does anyone have any good resource on how they work?

14,,learnprogramming,"Hi. The below code is part of a sample problem to help with preparing to apply to internships as a part of the co-op program at my university. I'm still early in my learning, but I want to begin to approach and solve problems like this.

This is my first post here so I hope I'm formatting things properly.

The goal is to find any bugs and provide thoughts or comments on the implementation of the code.

How should I work through something like this?

My initial thoughts are:

* I'm most familiar with c++ but there are some syntax differences that make me think it's not c++ but it's close.
* obviously we are missing other functions/data types used by this function, but I think that's the point since we should be able to infer how it works
* I'm not familiar with the function parameters specifically the ""out"" outputs? I haven't seen this before likely a language difference if it were c++ the outputs would be reference parameters i think
* I think a dynamic array of size 2 is being initialized in line 17. I'm not sure the syntax is correct because I'm not sure the DateTime\[\] beginning the line should be there.
   * but it appears DateTime is a function in line 20
* line 18 I'm wondering if "".Length"" should be the size of the array or if this is the length of the month? I'm not sure what .Length refers to.
* line 20 uses the function DateTime to return a string into the array monthStart
* line 23 it appears there are 3 functions one for UTC timezone one for local and one that compares the two to get the offset but I'm not familiar with the syntax
* then in line 26 and 27 we are finalizing the outputs but adjusting them for the offset
* I'm not sure if I have thoughts on the implementation, I wonder if getting the offset earlier would improve efficiency

Ultimately my end goal is to be able to make GUI based applications that could be deployed on primarily Windows, but potentially also web. So cross platform deployment would be preferred.

I have an odd stipulation though. Despite being a primarily Windows based user day to day, I would prefer to keep my development time spent only in Mac OS. The battery life and multitasking capability for me while mobile on my MacBook is preferred even over using Bootcamp. It's just how it is - despite how ridiculous it sounds. 

--- 

But I've looked at plenty of options. I like the design element of C# and WPF, but isn't compatible with Mac OS of course. But then I've had recommendations of Python and PySimplGUI, however while it feels easy to understand does feel a little.. lacking in overall scope and capability. I will say I do enjoy Python though, for what I've learned so far. 

My knowledge right now is basics of Python and a tad of C# but nothing to do anything wild with.

I've seen a few other options such as JS and Electron, which I know is part of what Discord is made from. However Javascript from my understanding has a pretty rough learning curve. 

I'm fine with learning, but I also like to see results WHILE I'm learning. Such as when I was doing the ""Automate the Boring Stuff Python"" course.

19,,learnprogramming,"Hi! I'm learning about the 6502, and I'm finding it very interesting and educational.

I've been working through getting an understanding of all the opcodes, and I'm a bit confused by how the program counter relative indexing works.

So let's say the program counter is at $9000. The byte at 9000 is a BPL opcode, which says ""branch if the previous result was positive"" (technically, branch if the negative flag is not set). The operand on this is #$40, which means ""Jump 64 bytes ahead if you do end up branching"".

My question is this: It would seem to me like the 6502 will read the BPL instruction at $9000, then it will say ""Oh, I gotta get an operand!"" and increment the program counter to $9001, at which point it will see the #$40 and know that its command is to decide whether to jump.

If it decides to jump, does it jump #$40 bytes from the new program counter which was used to read the operand, or does it jump #$40 bytes from the original operand?

If it jumps, will it find its next opcode at $9040 or $9041?

Also, where should I find answers to this in the future? I'm certain with the amount the 6502 has been used, I could find it somewhere, but I can't seem to locate anything.

35,,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone,

I have the problem that my state won't be updated when I call my setState function. I've defined a custom hook with the following interface:

    interface State {
        url: string; 
        result: Array&lt;Result&gt;; 
    }

I declare my state like this:

    const [state, setState] = useState&lt;State&gt;({
        url: 'http://localhost:8000/api', 
        result: [], });

Everything works fine. When I click on a button my handler is called and I reach the function where the state should be updated:

    function changeUrl(url: string) {
    console.log(url);
    setState(state =&gt;
        update(state, {
            url: {$set: url},
            result: {$set: state.result},
        }));
    console.log(state.url); }

The first log prints the following: http://localhost:8000/api/?address=examplestreetThis is the url that should be the updated url state.

The second log prints: http://localhost:8000/api

As you can see the state won't be updated. Not in immediately and not when I wait a little bit.

I use the update function from the immutability-helper:

    import update from 'immutability-helper';

Cheers :)

Edit:

My effect hook is the following:

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const fetchData = async () =&gt; { 
            const apiCall = await fetch(state.url); 
            const data = await apiCall.json(); 
            showEvents(data); 
        }; 
        fetchData(); 
    }, [state.url]);

Initially when I ran the local test, the test failed. Turns out there was a bug in *the TMC* tester code. An IOException was not being thrown in their test code--which is why the test was failing--so I looked for the line in their test code where there was an error and implemented the exception into their test code. The tester then ran perfectly and my code passed all the tests. I was then asked if I wanted to submit my code to their servers. I hit yes, TMC tried to upload my code, and I got a compiler error (which seems to have something to do with the IOException yet again). I do not want to progress in the MOOC until I've solved this issue.

Here is the TMC test code with the line (line 140, highlighted) where the error I think is occurring, and the compiler error in full:

Also, I hope I’m not off-topic, if so, I'm sorry.

So, I’m **18 years old guy from France**. I’ve been programming since 11, I’m pretty **good in web development** (I mainly use VueJS that I love, I have skill in both back-end and front-end) and I have strong basics in C# (GUI too using XAML) too for software development. 

So, actually I’m facing a difficult choice : *I need to find a plan for next year as I’ll finally leave high school with bachelor's degree if everything goes well*.

Actually, the ideal to me is to not stay too much longer at school, a superior school in 3 years could be nice I think. I want to work as earlier as I can, also maybe set up my own business but not know (It will ask me more skills that are not only programming).

Also, to understand better the following list : I hate theory, I prefer practicing and also I'm not really good at maths and physics, why I'd like to avoid continuing learning that. 

**Here is choices I have now:**

* Doing a free/public school known as « *BTS* (French) » which means «  **Advanced Technician Certificate** » in English I think.  
**Problem I see :** This is not really specific, I’ll continue doing mathematics, physics while I’d like to do only programming
* Doing a free/public school (like above) but with an « ***Alternance*** (French) » which means *I’ll work in a company some days and being at school other days.*  
Problems are same as above but **I think this is for now the best for me** because I’ll be employee with a salary.
* Doing a **paid school**, I visited « My Digital School » which is a paid school in 3 or 5 years. Their courses looks interesting, It’s really **focused on programming** and **business-development** unlike « BTS » schools.  
Problems: **Very expensive** (6000€/year, I must do a student loan) and their diploma is **not always recognized** by the state which means potentially useless.
* Doing a **engineer school**, two exists in my city (« *ISEN* (paid) » and « *Polytech* (free) »), again there are 2 problems, it’s engineer school so maybe not really specific and focused on programming and most of people says it require a good level in mathematics and physics which I do not have.

I hope I well explained my situation, I'm a bit stuck. Don't hesitate to ask me to clarify things if you can't understand.

My questions are : 

* I’d like to get some advices of people in other countries who had to make this type of choice to working in this domain.
* Also if people made a school/study I quoted, what was your experience ?
* And finally, if someone have another solution to suggest, I take.

I’m trying to make the best choice to get a good situation, where I can do what I like and learn more from it.

Their courses looks interesting, It’s really &lt;strong&gt;focused on programming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;business-development&lt;/strong&gt; unlike « BTS » schools.&lt;br/&gt;
Problems: &lt;strong&gt;Very expensive&lt;/strong&gt; (6000€/year, I must do a student loan) and their diploma is &lt;strong&gt;not always recognized&lt;/strong&gt; by the state which means potentially useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing a &lt;strong&gt;engineer school&lt;/strong&gt;, two exists in my city (« &lt;em&gt;ISEN&lt;/em&gt; (paid) » and « &lt;em&gt;Polytech&lt;/em&gt; (free) »), again there are 2 problems, it’s engineer school so maybe not really specific and focused on programming and most of people says it require a good level in mathematics and physics which I do not have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I well explained my situation, I&amp;#39;m a bit stuck. Don&amp;#39;t hesitate to ask me to clarify things if you can&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d like to get some advices of people in other countries who had to make this type of choice to working in this domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also if people made a school/study I quoted, what was your experience ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, if someone have another solution to suggest, I take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to make the best choice to get a good situation, where I can do what I like and learn more from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for helping!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do? What combination of study materials should I use to not miss on the math and also keep applying what I learn?&lt;/p&gt;

I got a job interview for software engineer position on next Monday and this would be my very first professional job interview as a fresh graduate so I'm quite anxious about it. I graduated in electrical engineering so the software engineer was totally out of my field of study. The summary of the job scope was to code in C#, HTML5, SQL or PHP and to document the work and test the code. The problem is I'm not very familiar with those language. I only mentioned C and C++ language in my resume and to be honest I'm not very good in those language either as I don't get to use that language often in my field of study. My goal here is to learn as much as possible about those language before my interview and to avoid getting myself getting embarrassed during the IV. I won't get my hopes up on getting the job but at least I want to save some face. 
So what's your recommendation for me to gain some knowledge about those programming language? Maybe some good website or YouTube channel that you could recommend to me? I would be more than happy to hear your tips on how to face the job interview easily. Thank you.

Hope you are having a wonderful day. Just finished my first C programming course and am now on to part II! I learned a great amount and am looking forward to continuing my degree. I have a question to pose for my latest assignment. I won't post my whole code, as I don't think it is needed for this question, but will if necessary.

I need to create a calculator which takes user inputted data and returns an average. This is what I have:

**for**(g = 0; g &lt; num\_grades; ++g)

{

printf(""\\nEnter grade for student #%i: "", g+1);

scanf (""%i"", &amp;grades\[g\]);

total\_grade += grades\[g\];

**if** (grades\[g\] &lt; 0 || grades\[g\] &gt; 100)

{

printf(""\*\*\* Invalid grade entered. Please enter 0 - 100. \*\*\*\\n"");

\--g;

}

}

Everything works as it should. However, my issue is that I need the average to ONLY ADD valid data. When I run the program by entering only valid numbers, everything works perfect. When I run the program and enter invalid data, the condition works and has me type in a valid number, BUT at the end it will add the invalid data when calculating the average. I've tried so many things but can't seem to get it to ignore the invalid data. Part of me thinks I am overthinking this and it is a simple fix?

69,,learnprogramming,"I'm a fourth year CS major, graduating next year though because of a second major in math and a minor in electrical engineering.

I'm currently in an operating systems class where the teacher references/demonstrates use of the 6 step programming/development method. I've looked online and there are some variations of this so the steps include (it's more than six since i'm unsure how the substeps go):

1. Starting with your main function, write function description header (Function name, algorithm, pre/post conditions, exceptions)
2. Design your program/Outline (with comments) the process of the function
3. Go through your comments and figure out which functions are used for which steps; comment that out. As you're adding the comments for necessary functions, if there is some function you'll need to create for that step then you branch off to:
   1. write the function description and define the function (in my case in the appropriate separate .c file)
   2. resolve the return with a dummy value
   3. add the function also to the .h file
   4. if your function uses parameters of a new type you need to define, you branch again....
4. Once you're done with commenting out main, you write the code in main for each step.
5. Main is done. Now to the .c file. outline the steps for each function. 
6. Comment out which steps might call other functions; branch if the function calls another function and repeat 3.1-3.4 for the called function. Come back and repeat until all the steps have the specified functions commented.
7. top to bottom in the .c file write the code for each step of each function all while branching if needing to define global variables, defining new structs/dataTypes and branching more if a function needs you to make another function.

One can probably see how I might get lost somewhere in there. While it's an incredibly structured way of programming, I'm wondering if anyone who uses this method regularly feels like it's too unfocused. I have ADHD so im either hyperfocus on one task or not at all. It's really hard for me to get into step one, break it down into sub-steps then jump to a sub-step that, in my case likely involves working in a different file, only to come back to the other sub-steps, and then when done with those to come back to the original step to go to step two. Some sub-steps get broken down even more, to the point I feel like I'm just jumping all over and lose track of where I am. I think of it as a rabbit hole process; when you need something you follow it all the way down the rabbit hole until every thing is able to compile and then come back up and repeat. I can follow along with the professor just fine, but I can't remember when I'm on my own. 

I can see how this is good for programming, because it involves defining everything before any code has been written so that the ""shell"" of a program you create can still compile. Then, at every step of actually writing the code, you can compile successfully and not get yelled at about undefined variables or references, things being unresolved etc. which helps for debugging problems more quickly and leads to a lot cleaner, more organized code.

So really I'm just wondering if anyone else been required to use this method and has had the same problems/has tips for me? Maybe some of y'all use different methods that might be easier for someone like me?

Any help is much appreciated.",t2_szg8u,False,,0,False,6 step programming process?,[],r/learnprogramming,False,6,,0,False,t3_evi4eb,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580302631.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnprogramming,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fourth year CS major, graduating next year though because of a second major in math and a minor in electrical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently in an operating systems class where the teacher references/demonstrates use of the 6 step programming/development method. I&amp;#39;ve looked online and there are some variations of this so the steps include (it&amp;#39;s more than six since i&amp;#39;m unsure how the substeps go):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting with your main function, write function description header (Function name, algorithm, pre/post conditions, exceptions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your program/Outline (with comments) the process of the function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through your comments and figure out which functions are used for which steps; comment that out. As you&amp;#39;re adding the comments for necessary functions, if there is some function you&amp;#39;ll need to create for that step then you branch off to:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write the function description and define the function (in my case in the appropriate separate .c file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve the return with a dummy value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add the function also to the .h file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your function uses parameters of a new type you need to define, you branch again....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re done with commenting out main, you write the code in main for each step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main is done. Now to the .c file. outline the steps for each function. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment out which steps might call other functions; branch if the function calls another function and repeat 3.1-3.4 for the called function. Come back and repeat until all the steps have the specified functions commented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;top to bottom in the .c file write the code for each step of each function all while branching if needing to define global variables, defining new structs/dataTypes and branching more if a function needs you to make another function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can probably see how I might get lost somewhere in there. While it&amp;#39;s an incredibly structured way of programming, I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone who uses this method regularly feels like it&amp;#39;s too unfocused. I have ADHD so im either hyperfocus on one task or not at all. It&amp;#39;s really hard for me to get into step one, break it down into sub-steps then jump to a sub-step that, in my case likely involves working in a different file, only to come back to the other sub-steps, and then when done with those to come back to the original step to go to step two. Some sub-steps get broken down even more, to the point I feel like I&amp;#39;m just jumping all over and lose track of where I am. I think of it as a rabbit hole process; when you need something you follow it all the way down the rabbit hole until every thing is able to compile and then come back up and repeat. I can follow along with the professor just fine, but I can&amp;#39;t remember when I&amp;#39;m on my own. &lt;/p&gt;

Then, giving my passion for bitcoin i started playing with Python and Rust at a basic level again and took some Coursera courses.

I am starting my journey learning front-end right now following various online material. Starting to get the hang of HTML -&gt; CSS and then will tackle Java Script.

* I have a wife and kids - my priority
* I work Customer Service for an American company. My background is mostly in management.
* I work full time - with commute - I am away from home 10 hours a day.
* I work awful night hours to adapt to US time - takes a toll on family.
* I net \~ $50/day
* Naturally, I'm a native English speaker 
* Canadian citizen still, have a Canadian address, phone number &amp; Bank Account (its TD so can be used in US)

My goals;

* Do something more interesting.
* Work from home/ remotely.
* Make more than $50/ day, but willing to start there.
* Have more flexibility to my schedule

The reason for my post is to simply ask, will this be realistic after I've developed some skills before I sink all my free time into it? 

I have read many saying nobody will hire a person remotely that has no experience, but I believe I bring a unique ""cost/ risk"" scenario.

But the connection between those two halves isn't really covered at all and it's something I'm very curious about. I was just wondering if someone could give me a brief explanation, even just a breezy one-paragraph summary, of how code can actually communicate with hardware peripherals. Or, even better, if someone could recommend articles, books, videos, something I could use to learn about this sort of thing.

For example...

Say I manufacture a USB videogame controller and plug it into a port. Presumably the slot sends some kind of signal that some peripheral has been inserted, and the OS picks up on that signal. Then the peripheral sends further signals as buttons are pressed, and the OS receives them. I write a game that the controller should control. Is there some kind of API the OS offers to list connected peripherals and 'subscribe' to their signals, so I can handle ""Signal 00000011 means button X was pressed and the character should move 1 step right""? Is it some kind of port that fires events, or a hardware ID I can poll through some OS function? Does the program ask the OS for exclusive access to USB Port #3? Does each device have to send some kind of spec description through saying ""programs can send data to me through this port"", so my program can send something back, like a ""change the LED color to red"" signal?

In the Python stdlib documentation I've read, I don't think I've ever seen anything like a ""send data to/receive data from a USB port"" function, so this whole area feels mysterious to me. I don't really know what's going on under the hood when software speaks to hardware and I'd really like to.

I've tried to convert the floating number into a string but react throws back an error saying 'lat and lon is not a float number so I tried using `toFixed(3)` to shorten the lat and lon to 3 decimal places and then convert them back into a floating number from a string and also changing the functions around to change the order of operation but the lat and the lon still remain blank and i still get the same errors.

I am however fascinated by data science and machine learning so I have set out to learn Python and R over the next 8 months before school starts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some basics of python and R from some courses as an Undergrad. But now that I am trying to learn on my own I have no idea how to practice or try any code without putting my personal computer at risk. How can I run code without using my computer&amp;#39;s console or at least use the console but in a safe environment. The last thing I want is to accidentally brick my computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been told to use Anaconda but I have no idea how to use it. Any recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;

I have been playing around with linux for the last whole year as a hobby, and now I'd say I'm pretty comfortable with daily usage. It has been a great experience for me, as now I know more options in life. One of them is to get rid of the control from the big companys (google, dropbox, ..)!

Despite other existing linux server service (eg linode), it seems that I have to setup a server myself. After all, clouds are just other dudes' computers. Also, since I work in different places, the server should be set over internet. Skimming through some basic tutorials, I soon realized this task is a beast of another level. There are so many terms and protocols (router, modem, DNS, basic security issues ...) out there, and a single blog entry is too small to contain all of them.

I wonder, then, that is there a better self-contained (modern) tutorial that teaches how to setup a linux server over internet? I'd like to be more open-minded, and hope to also learn some basics of internet security at the end of the course.

&amp;#x200B;

So i'm learning to code to hopefully make a career change in the hopefully not too distant future, after some research i decided to pick Java as my first language, an apparent good all rounder that will teach me the basics and fundamentals well.

I've just completed Week 1 of the new MOOC course and loving it, found it challenging in parts but nothing i couldn't handle, week 2 has just been released.

&amp;#x200B;

I also really want to do The Odin Project, the stack they teach looks perfect to what i want to have in my skill set to hopefully get a Job in the software engineering field.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm tempted to do both at the same time, especially since the MOOC course week releases are staggered so there's a potential i'll finish week 2 before week 3 is released, my only worry is i'm not sure as a beginner learning these two different courses side by side at the same time may have a negative affect. I'm thinking maybe sticking to Java and seeing it all the way through and then start TOP is the wise choice but i'm really not sure, in my head i just want to learn as much as possible as quick as possible really!

160,,learnprogramming,"Hey folks,In a lecture for year 1 of my computer science degree yesterday my professor gave an example of a program. The program created four instances of the ""Die"" class, initialized the dice to have 6 sides, added each die to an array list, and then rolled each die twice, outputting the results to the screen. My professor showed two ways of iterating through the dice to roll them. The first way, you have two nested for loops, one for iterating through the dice and one for iterating through the each set to have each die roll twice. The second method used only 1 for loop and a conditional statement that waited until the for loop that was iterating through each die reached the end of it's loop, and then manually reset the for loop control variable down to -1 to cause it to loop through again. An additional variable was used to note whether the loop has already executed once to prevent the conditional statement from infinitely looping the for loop.

I asked my prof why the second one would be used, considering the first method appeared much cleaner, and he told me that the second one is actually preferred due to it having a faster calculation time. My prof told me this was due to something called big O notation. However, after googling big O notation I do not understand how using two for loops causes increased complexity here, as the same number of actions (rolling 4 dice 2 times each) are executed regardless of whether they are nested inside an additional for loop or not.

Thanks in advance for any perspective you can provide!

PS: I can write and attach code that does what his program did if you folks would find that helpful. I wasn't worried about it because it's mostly a theory question rather than a syntax/code question, but if you would find it helpful to clear things up I can certainly do so.

Well as the title suggests I'm currently in week 4 of a 16 week coding bootcamp and find myself struggling a little. So far we've been through Ruby, SQL and have just moved onto using Sinatra this week.

It took me a loooong time to eventually realise I'd need to use something like an if/else statement to manage the logic of the game. I feel like that should perhaps come to me a little quicker.

I'm pretty certain the solution to my problem is simply to practice, practice, practice. I guess I'm looking for some reassurance that this pays off in the end!

194,,learnprogramming,"Hi! Context on the problem: I have this spring boot project and I am trying to auto-generate plantuml files using the sketch it intellij plugin in order to keep the uml diagrams as up to date with the src code as possible. The problem with this plugin is the auto-generated plantuml files have syntax errors preventing a uml diagram to be shown from the file. These files are being placed in the packages they are being created from so I will need to find all the files ending with the `.plantuml` extension

The generated syntax is as follows:

    namespace  {
        namespace packageName {
            className1 {
                someMethod1
            }
        }
    }
    
    namespace  {
        namespace packageName {
            className2 {
                someMethod2
            }
        }
    }

The syntax error is on the `namespace  {` part. It should have a name following the namespace similar to the inner namespace. I've also noticed that when the syntax is manually corrected, the image  has these empty boxes with the namespace names. Now when I remove all the namespaces the image is rendered perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

Desired Outcome:

I want to write a script that will be executed on a maven build that will go into to each of these files and make the syntax as follows:

    className1 {
        someMethod1
    }
    
    className2 {
        someMethod2
    }

So basically I just want to remove the namespaces and their corresponding curly braces, but keep the class block.

&amp;#x200B;

 If it were java code I would try to iterate through the directory tree and look for the files ending in `.plantuml`. Then I would go through the file line by line and for every line that says namespace I would replace the namespace line and the first  closing curly brace found.

You can add big text and code blocks for the code.

It makes notes look great!

The problem with this is that: it's online only and with monthly payments.

Is there a 1-time-pay and offline version of this?

I tried many tools, but they don't meet the criteria:

1. **OneNote:** Doesn't have code highlight support.
2. **Cherrytree:** It's either code highlight OR formatting, not both.

What I want to do is make it easier for myself as I somewhat custom fill my cover letter to include the company name and job title in my word doc. If I have to do this for around 20 applications a week you can imagine the amount of copy and pastes I have to do. 

What I want to do is script code or learn which programing language will enable me to scrap the company name and job title into my desired word cover letter sections and do this for all the jobs I have saved. 

E.g: Site I have jobs saved in: [https://www.seek.co.nz/my-activity/saved-jobs](https://www.seek.co.nz/my-activity/saved-jobs) 

I have limited to no knowledge about programing and am attempting to learn but due to current situation and overall being a heavy thinker I don't do shit and apparently the best way to learn to code is to find solutions to your problems:)

What I want to do is make it easier for myself as I somewhat custom fill my cover letter to include the company name and job title in my word doc. If I have to do this for around 20 applications a week you can imagine the amount of copy and pastes I have to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to do is script code or learn which programing language will enable me to scrap the company name and job title into my desired word cover letter sections and do this for all the jobs I have saved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g: Site I have jobs saved in: &lt;a href=""https://www.seek.co.nz/my-activity/saved-jobs""&gt;https://www.seek.co.nz/my-activity/saved-jobs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have limited to no knowledge about programing and am attempting to learn but due to current situation and overall being a heavy thinker I don&amp;#39;t do shit and apparently the best way to learn to code is to find solutions to your problems:) &lt;/p&gt;

Hey guys,

I'm starting to learn object oriented programming and I chose Java to do so.

My Question is: Do I write these getters and setters for my variables in the beginning of my class right after my constructor or can I write my methods before and then my getters and setters are followed afterwards? Whats the Style Guide? First getters and setters then methods or the other way around?

I really hope I made my question clear :)

209,,learnprogramming,"I'm planning how I will code a website. I intend for the project to be pretty large for me. So I want to start by coding it right instead of taking on debt.

My question is, which way is the modern way to code a site?

I've heard some things about modern websites being built with code that is rendered in your browser instead of fetched off a server. Meaning, the first HTTP request gets you a pile of HTML and JavaScript which the browser then reorganizes into different pages when you click links etc. Basically something like JavaScript changing a div's .innerHTML over and over to serve you different sites ... or \*something\* like that, I'm just learning.

Versus the old way which is like:

Go to the homepage, index.html. Wanna go to another page? Better send another HTTP request to get more data from the server (wait, and wait, and maybe wait some more).

Do I seem to have this right? The modern way is to use the browser to render different parts of the site from JavaScript code?

How is that programmed? I imagine .innerHTML gets used a lot (maybe I should look at React's internals).

I&amp;#39;m not really sure what I did, but I would appreciate any feedback to help get it running.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the description, please don't give me the answer just point me in the right direction if you can.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

""a"" = 1, ""b"" = 2, etc.

## Example

    alphabet_position(""The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."")

Should return ""20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11""(as a string)

My code:

&amp;#x200B;

import re

def alphabet\_position(text):

text=re.sub('\[\^A-Za-z0-9\]+', '', text)

lower\_case=text.lower()

string=list(lower\_case)

x=""""

for letters in string:

number=ord(letters) - 96

x += str(number)+' '

return(x)

&amp;#x200B;

And this is the result I get:

'20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11 ' should equal '20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11'

'20 8 5 14 1 18 23 8 1 12 2 1 3 15 14 19 1 20 13 9 4 14 9 7 8 20 ' should equal '20 8 5 14 1 18 23 8 1 12 2 1 3 15 14 19 1 20 13 9 4 14 9 7 8 20'

'-47 -45 -43 -41 -43 -43 -46 -41 -43 -40 ' should equal ''

&amp;#x200B;

For the following input:

from random import randint

test.assert\_equals(alphabet\_position(""The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.""), ""20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"")

I looked for other DB's than MySQL (we only had that in school yet) so I found out about NoSQL databases. I looked into MongoDB a bit, and found it to be quite confusing.

So as far as I got it, MongoDBs advantage is that for example a user isn't split into X many tables, but stored in one file. Different users can have different attributes or multiple of them. That makes sense to me.

Where it gets confusing is this: u have for example a reddit post. It stores the post and all it's comments in a file. But how do you get the user from the comments?

Just a name isn't enough since there could be multiple users using a name (okay, reddit wasn't the best example here...) so you would have to save 1. either the whole user, making it really redundent and storage heavy, or 2. save the ID of the user, but as far as I get it, the whole point of it is to NOT make relations...

While working on some code, I wanted to ask the user for input at the command line rather than using a printf/scanf. Upon doing this, I've come across a problem that I don't know how to fix. 

The problem is that when no command-line value is entered, the code will return the error line that I wrote, but it won't stop running. I have to enter cntrl + c to manually do that. When I do enter a command-line value of one integer, the code runs and terminates as it should.

I am trying to solve this question:  
[https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/372581](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/372581)  


1. If you look at the comments section, there is a brute force way of doing it whereby we ""break"" each connection one at a time and check if this breaks the graph (i.e. if there aren't the same number of verticies after completing DFS then this connection is critical). Now i understand for this, a DFS on an adjacency list is O(V+E) because we can go through each vertex and then go through each of the edges in the list for that vertex. Now because we are doing this for each connection where each connection is an edge, the total time complexity of this brute force should be O(E \*(V+E) ) because for the number of edge we complete DFS each time.   


Now moving onto Tarjans algorithm to solve this problem.

I don't particularly understand why this has a time complexity of O(V+E) only when i see two things:

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {		
                if (disc[i] == -1) {
    			dfs(i, low, disc, graph, res, i);
    		}
    	}
    
    ... and
    
    private void dfs(int u, int[] low, int[] disc, List&lt;Integer&gt;[] graph, List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; res, int pre) {
    	disc[u] = low[u] = ++time; // discover u
    	for (int j = 0; j &lt; graph[u].size(); j++) {
    		int v = graph[u].get(j);
    		if (v == pre) {
    			continue; // if parent vertex, ignore
    		}
    		if (disc[v] == -1) { // if not discovered
    			dfs(v, low, disc, graph, res, u);
    			low[u] = Math.min(low[u], low[v]);
    			if (low[v] &gt; disc[u]) {
    				// u - v is critical, there is no path for v to reach back to u or previous vertices of u
    				res.add(Arrays.asList(u, v));
    			}
    		} else { // if v discovered and is not parent of u, update low[u], cannot use low[v] because u is not subtree of v
    			low[u] = Math.min(low[u], disc[v]);
    		}
    	}
    }

Essentially for each vertices if not discovered we will perform DFS, since DFS is O (V + E) for adjacency list, I don't understand how this can be only be O (V + E) for overall time complexity, should it not be O (V \* ( V + E ) ) given this condition?  


2. As for space complexity of BOTH implementations (brute force and tarjans) of stack space for recursion I am confused. On one hand I want to say we can only go as deep as all of the unseen verticies so O (E) for stack space, but if we have a run time complexity of O ( V + E) then would this not mean we might have O (V + E) stack calls as well?

276,,learnprogramming,"One personal project I want to work on is a utility program for Settlers of Catan that will keep track of points, resources produced with certain die rolls, and other things. One part I'm thinking about now is how to represent three pieces that can be built: Settlements, Cities, and Harbor Settlements.

For those not familiar with Catan, the quick rundown is that all three produce resources. A settlement has to be built first, and you can upgrade it into a city or a harbor settlement. And, more rarely, a city can become a settlement. (Depending on which expansions you're using.) 

My other goal with this project is to be able to have it on my GitHub as an example of something good I've done. I'll be programming in Java and using a GUI to control how a user interacts with the program.

My first thought of how to represent these was to have a class called Settlement and another class called City. (The differences between Cities and Harbor Settlements are, negligible enough to be handled without a separate class I think.) City would extend settlement and then have a few more private members of its own. Using inheritance made sense to me because a City is a settlement, just with more. 

But one issue I thought of is that using two separate classes is that because a Settlement Object could commonly need to become a City Object, there would be extra copying of parameters when creating a new City and getting its settlement info. So the second idea was that instead of using inheritance, a City could have a private member of the Settlement Class inside it. And then a Settlement being upgrade to a City would have a wrapper class of City around it. Another benefit I saw to this is that it would make downgrading a City back to a Settlement very easy. The downside, and I don't know if this would be right, I saw to this is that it would add some syntax so that, compared with inheritance, instead of doing cityObject.settlementMethod() I'd be doing cityObject.getSettlementObject().settlementMethod() and I want to use this project as something to showcase on GitHub so I don't know if that's something common in the industry that would be okay or if it would be something that would say ""bad programming methods.""

Third option I thought of was to use the Decorator design pattern, moving the City class private members to the Settlement class and then having City be a Decorator that gave those members functionality. But the downside I'm seeing to this is that while the Decorator adds functionality, it doesn't take it away. So I'm guessing that a City -&gt; Settlement transition, which though rare, would not be doable with such a Design pattern. (Unless I created a new Settlement Object using only Settlement info from the Decorated object.)

Fourth option I thought of is to just have one class with all the possible data members in it and use the GUI to be the sole way that differentiates cities and settlements (along with some backend bookeeping.) I'm not yet sure if this would be messy or elegant as I'm still in the early planning stages.

So that's how I've been thinking about this issue so far. I'm hoping some of you can offer insight into things I may be overlooking.

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with Catan, the quick rundown is that all three produce resources. A settlement has to be built first, and you can upgrade it into a city or a harbor settlement. And, more rarely, a city can become a settlement. (Depending on which expansions you&amp;#39;re using.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other goal with this project is to be able to have it on my GitHub as an example of something good I&amp;#39;ve done. I&amp;#39;ll be programming in Java and using a GUI to control how a user interacts with the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought of how to represent these was to have a class called Settlement and another class called City. (The differences between Cities and Harbor Settlements are, negligible enough to be handled without a separate class I think.) City would extend settlement and then have a few more private members of its own. Using inheritance made sense to me because a City is a settlement, just with more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one issue I thought of is that using two separate classes is that because a Settlement Object could commonly need to become a City Object, there would be extra copying of parameters when creating a new City and getting its settlement info. So the second idea was that instead of using inheritance, a City could have a private member of the Settlement Class inside it. And then a Settlement being upgrade to a City would have a wrapper class of City around it. Another benefit I saw to this is that it would make downgrading a City back to a Settlement very easy. The downside, and I don&amp;#39;t know if this would be right, I saw to this is that it would add some syntax so that, compared with inheritance, instead of doing cityObject.settlementMethod() I&amp;#39;d be doing cityObject.getSettlementObject().settlementMethod() and I want to use this project as something to showcase on GitHub so I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s something common in the industry that would be okay or if it would be something that would say &amp;quot;bad programming methods.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third option I thought of was to use the Decorator design pattern, moving the City class private members to the Settlement class and then having City be a Decorator that gave those members functionality. But the downside I&amp;#39;m seeing to this is that while the Decorator adds functionality, it doesn&amp;#39;t take it away. So I&amp;#39;m guessing that a City -&amp;gt; Settlement transition, which though rare, would not be doable with such a Design pattern. (Unless I created a new Settlement Object using only Settlement info from the Decorated object.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth option I thought of is to just have one class with all the possible data members in it and use the GUI to be the sole way that differentiates cities and settlements (along with some backend bookeeping.) I&amp;#39;m not yet sure if this would be messy or elegant as I&amp;#39;m still in the early planning stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this issue so far. I&amp;#39;m hoping some of you can offer insight into things I may be overlooking. Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I do understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If current is null, then obviously we don&amp;#39;t have the data in the tree (&lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; throws the Exception).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If current has two child nodes, then replace current&amp;#39;s data with its successor, and then delete the successor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;code&gt;successor()&lt;/code&gt; returns the node of the inorder successor to the data (which I understand how to get), and the &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; class contains a tree node&amp;#39;s data, left, and right references.&lt;/p&gt;

First, let me apologize. English is not my first language, so I hope this is bearable to read.

Alright, here we go with some background information.

My name is Dan(27M), I am a full-time bachelor student, specializing in urban studies. This is a course that focusses on multiple aspects of daily urban life, ranging from people their daily patterns in life to the technology they use, which requires us to work with data.

With this in mind, I decided to jump on the new year's resolution band-wagon. A little late, but rather late than never. And have set 3 personal goals, which one of my goals is to increase my knowledge regarding data. After watching some videos on youtube, on deciding which programming language would be best for my ultimate pallet-town experience I said: ""I choose you Python!"". And got as far as downloading Python and Pycharm.

However, with my excitement also comes a little bit of anxiety. Since to me, I am about to explore the unknown with no idea how to actually start.

I have been dying to ask someone these 3 questions:

*""I have had little-to-no experience with R studio, and have some basic level math skills. ""* Will this stop obstruct me from learning Python at some point?

*""Besides Python, what should also be my focus on?*"" e.g. Theoretically (books/authors), Tutorials, Bootcamps, etc ( could be anything actually, all help is appreciated)!

And the most important one *""How to avoid the rut?""* I know it is a learning process that is not always interesting or fun to do, and even a fully committed mind may struggle some. Once again any advice would be appreciated.

306,,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone! Five years ago, almost to the day, I quit my job and started learning Java and Android. I spent the next three years basically unemployed (with a little money coming in for one year as a part time tutor and some money coming in through renting out space in my apartment), but I basically burned through my savings and lived on nothing.

Two years ago I got my first job as a programmer - an internship actually. They didn't want to hire me at first, and I could tell, so I asked them if they'd give me an internship instead. It felt weird to ask for an internship at the age of 30, but I'm really glad I did - I was able to prove my abilities, and got hired on, albeit at a pretty low salary for a programmer in the Midwest (50k a year). Still, I was thrilled!

Two years later, and I am moving on to another company, and they're hiring me as a lead developer - two job titles above my current one, skipping right over Sr developer! I'm so happy about it. I'll be making between 115-125k a year in an area with a low cost of living, working 9-5, with good benefits. It's better than I could have even hoped for.

Overall, learning to code was the second best thing I've ever done, (besides marrying my wife). It was really hard, and it took a long time (three hard years!) and along the way I had so many doubts and struggles. I gave up often, sometimes for months at a time, and I often felt bad that I didn't learn when I was younger (I was about 26 or 27 when I started learning). I felt like I had wasted so much time, and that I was continuing to waste my time, and it would never work. I had people tell me it would never work. But it did, and it can for you too.

Things I learned along the way, if you're interested:

When I started, I saw a lot of red on the screen. A lot of errors. A more experienced developer told me ""don't worry about it - debugging is basically the job! Most of your time as a programmer is spent fixing broken stuff you've written, just get used to it.""

Making my first app - it really helped to just make something, no matter how crappy. My first app was just one button, and I'd track how many times you pressed it in a minute and if you beat the high score. It was crappy, but it was fun to hand it to my friends, to compete and laugh at this crappy game I made. The second app was just a button that played a song by Nirvana. The third was similar, but it was actually good looking, and played David Bowie songs and music videos. Each time, I got better.

Find a mentor if you can! My brother didn't know Android, but he knew Java, and was there to teach me a lot. I know not everyone has that. If you don't have someone like that, consider your options - sometimes community colleges can help, or you can find someone to help you online, or perhaps you can find someone in some other way.

I also thought that I needed to make a big splash by making a big app that impresses people by getting like a million downloads. I spent nearly a year on and off working on one app, and it wasn't a big success. Then I realized that it might be a better idea to just make a bunch of small apps that don't take as much work. That actually worked for me - when I got my first internship, I heard them saying something like ""he has 5 apps on the play store, so he's done this before."" Of course, they were decent efforts, I spent time on them, but sometimes quantity matters and making things quickly is a more fun way to learn than trying to make one perfect thing.

Don't worry about how old you are.

Don't beat yourself up. 

If you're totally new, consider mobile apps, or making websites in JavaScript (I personally suggest the app route). One reason to focus on those two is that they both involve visual displays of your abilities. If you're looking for your first job, you can just pull your phone put of your pocket, and someone can quickly see if you've made something good or not. You can easily prove your abilities. However, if your focus is more on back end, server side code with no UI, people have no idea if what you made is good or not, and if you don't have the credentials or resume, it might be hard to get credibility. Your code (unfortunately) is often judged on how it looks, so pick something where you can make an impressive UI. Also, companies will be more willing to hire you in those kinds of roles - they're comfortable having an unproven person change a button's size or color, but they're probably uncomfortable with letting an unproven rookie mess around with their servers.

Also, it took me three years to get a job, but I wasn't exactly working 8 hours a day - honestly I think I probably spent no more than 20 hours a week studying, and took months off at a time. Sometimes I'd work 10 hours a week. I admittedly could have gone faster, but I just found the process of learning to be absolutely exhausting. And it was! That's ok, the process is difficult. I don't think it is even possible to spend 8 hours in a row learning to code, I was and am still incapable of doing that. And that's ok, you can still be successful despite that, just keep at it.

Don't be afraid to ask for an internship! It was a little embarrassing to ask for one at 30, but it might have changed my life. I learned more in the three months as an intern than I had in the entire year previously. Once you get in a company, your learning can really take off, so study up and try to get in a company that is willing to train you. I would have been happy to do it for minimum wage if it meant getting trained, and I'm sure a lot of you understand that.

Five years ago, almost to the day, I quit my job and started learning Java and Android. I spent the next three years basically unemployed (with a little money coming in for one year as a part time tutor and some money coming in through renting out space in my apartment), but I basically burned through my savings and lived on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I got my first job as a programmer - an internship actually. They didn&amp;#39;t want to hire me at first, and I could tell, so I asked them if they&amp;#39;d give me an internship instead. It felt weird to ask for an internship at the age of 30, but I&amp;#39;m really glad I did - I was able to prove my abilities, and got hired on, albeit at a pretty low salary for a programmer in the Midwest (50k a year). Still, I was thrilled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, and I am moving on to another company, and they&amp;#39;re hiring me as a lead developer - two job titles above my current one, skipping right over Sr developer! I&amp;#39;m so happy about it. I&amp;#39;ll be making between 115-125k a year in an area with a low cost of living, working 9-5, with good benefits. It&amp;#39;s better than I could have even hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to predict the price of a building based on factors like ""building type,"" ""number of bathrooms,"" ""Years Old,"" etc. I thought random forest would have been a good choice, however, the RMSE value I got was much lower than I had hoped. Am I misunderstanding something?

What I did: The first thing was cleaning up the dataset. The forest algorithm doesn't take in chars so I changed any char value to a numerical value (ex: Changing Yes to 1 and No to 0). The other thing I noticed was that the column ""LotFrontage"" in the train and test file contained NAs in certain rows, which would result in a prediction price of NA.

I ended up removing that column from the training model and that solved the problem. However, as I mentioned, my testing score ended up being really low. For reference, the Master RMSE was 21333 whereas mine was 40000. Did removing that 1 column out of the 16 columns really mess up the predictions that much? What could I have done instead to include the column? I know that you can delete rows with NA, however, the train and test sets were different files and I wasn't allowed to delete any rows in the test set for scoring purposes.

    # r code for reference
    library(data.table)
    library(randomForest)
    library(tidyverse)
    
    # These 3 columns contained char, I changed them to a numerical

The forest algorithm doesn&amp;#39;t take in chars so I changed any char value to a numerical value (ex: Changing Yes to 1 and No to 0). The other thing I noticed was that the column &amp;quot;LotFrontage&amp;quot; in the train and test file contained NAs in certain rows, which would result in a prediction price of NA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up removing that column from the training model and that solved the problem. However, as I mentioned, my testing score ended up being really low. For reference, the Master RMSE was 21333 whereas mine was 40000. Did removing that 1 column out of the 16 columns really mess up the predictions that much? What could I have done instead to include the column? I know that you can delete rows with NA, however, the train and test sets were different files and I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to delete any rows in the test set for scoring purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# r code for reference
library(data.table)
library(randomForest)
library(tidyverse)

# These 3 columns contained char, I changed them to a numerical 
# representation in the csv.
# BldgType (0:4), Heating (0:3), CentralAir (0:1)

train &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;train.csv&amp;quot;)

# I start from 3 since column 1 is just id and column 2 is where the NAs were
train &amp;lt;- train[,c(3:18)]

test &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;test.csv&amp;quot;)

# Don&amp;#39;t think I need to change any default values.
model1 &amp;lt;- randomForest(SalePrice ~ ., data = train, importance = TRUE)
pred &amp;lt;- predict(model1, test)

# pred is given to kaggle for scoring
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s any other information you need, let me know and I&amp;#39;ll add it. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting Started

For running and testing the program in Linux download the graph algorithms library source code files. Open in Linux terminal downloaded folder and compile it. To simplify the compilation, I wrote a makefile. Type in terminal make command and program will be compiled. The executable file will be named as folder name.

In main.cpp file shown how to use graph algorithms library. For building graph in main.cpp file created an object of graph class and called on it graph class add\_edge() method. You can build a graph with your own data using graph class add\_  methods.

**DFS algorithm:** The DFS algorithm is implemented in dfs.hpp and dfs.cpp files. In main.cpp file created an object of DFS class with input of above created initial graph and start vertex 1. Then DFS algorithm traversal output is printed on terminal.

    Graphs DFS algorithm output:
     1  --&gt;  2
     2  --&gt;  1,  4
     3  --&gt;  4,  6
     4  --&gt;  2,  3
     5  --&gt;  7
     6  --&gt;  3, 11, 12
     7  --&gt; 11,  5, 10
     8  --&gt; 10, 16
     9  --&gt; 15
    10  --&gt;  7,  8
    11  --&gt;  6,  7
    12  --&gt;  6, 13
    13  --&gt; 12
    14  --&gt; 15
    15  --&gt; 16,  9, 14
    16  --&gt;  8, 15

\*\*Connectivity algorithm:\*\*The connectivity algorithm is implemented in connectivity.hpp and connectivity.cpp files. The initial is connected. In order to demonstrate conectivity algorithm in main.cpp file from initial graph removed vertex 7 and edge (6, 11) with g.remove\_vertex(7) and g.remove\_edge(6, 11) methods respectively. Now we have two separate disjoint subgraphs. The connectivity algorithm tests for connectivity condition and print out in terminal disjoint subgraphs of graph.

**Biconectivity algorithm:** The biconnectivity algorithm is implemented in biconnectivity.hpp and biconnectivity.cpp files. The initial graph is strongly connected i.e biconnected. In order to demonstrate biconnectivity algorithm in main.cpp file from initial graph removed the edge (6-11) with method g.remove\_edge(6, 11). Then in main.cpp file created an object of biconnectivity class with input of above created initial graph. In The graph vertice 4 and 7 is cutvertices: if if these will be removed we'll receive three separate not connected graphs. The biconnectivity algorithm output is printed on terminal.

**Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm:** The Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is implemented in dijkstra.hpp and dijkstra.cpp files. In main.cpp file created an object of Dijkstra class with input of initial graph. Then on Dijkstra type object called set\_edge\_weight(const vertex&amp;, const vertex&amp;, double) method, where first two arguments are graph edges identifiers and last third argument is edge weight. Start vertex is 1 and end vertex is 14. Algorithm will finding shortest path in weighted graph from vertices 1 to 14.

    dijkstra dijk(g);
    
    dijk.set_edge_weight(1, 2, 1);
    dijk.set_edge_weight(1, 4, 5);	
    dijk.set_edge_weight(2, 4, 3);
    dijk.set_edge_weight(2, 5, 2);
    dijk.set_edge_weight(3, 4, 4);
    ...
    ...
    ...
    dijk.set_edge_weight(11, 14, 1);
    dijk.set_edge_weight(12, 13, 2);
    dijk.set_edge_weight(14, 15, 1);
    dijk.set_edge_weight(15, 16, 2);
    
    dijk.shortest_paths_from(1);
    dijk.get_shortest_path_to(14);

After execution of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm the shortest path is printed on terminal.

I have a Booking class, and I’m not sure what data members it should have, or which classes it should be a data member of. Currently the booking has a booking ID, a start and end date, a room number and a hotel name.

The Room class, the Hotel class and the Customer class all have lists of Bookings. My thinking is that the Room class has to have a list of bookings so that when making a new booking, the program iterates through each room, and then compares the new booking against existing bookings in that room for date overlaps. If none are found, the booking is added to the room’s list of bookings, the hotel’s list and the customer’s list.

I’m unsure of the list of bookings in the Hotel class is necessary, as it would be easy to iterate through all the rooms to get a complete list of bookings and this would also mean less data duplication. 

I’m also unsure of the customer having a list of bookings, as although this makes it easy to get a complete set of the customer’s bookings, could it also be implemented as adding a Customer data member to the Booking class, which, along with removing the Hotel’s list, would mean there’s only one list of bookings, making deleting/cancelling bookings more logical?

If I were to draw a UML diagram of my program, the Booking class would be linked to three different classes, creating a ‘circle’ in the diagram. I remember being taught that UML diagrams should ideally resemble a tree?

Another uncertainty is if I have created enough classes. I previously attempted this exercise a couple of years ago (unsuccessfully), and some other students in my group had classes like BookingManager and RoomManager. Is there an advantage to additional classes like this?

I've completed level one and the first challenge of level 2, but I figured I'd stop in here and check about if anyone else has experience with this. 

The main things I'm worried about are code quality and what google is still tracking in my searches. I read up on the challenge and learned that people are selected based on a relatively fine-grained analysis of their search history, but is that something I should worry about now that the challenge has started? Not gonna lie, I suck at programming. When I got the invitation I was literally looking up how to do a try catch block in python because I had forgotten for the millionth time that it's ""except"" and not ""catch"" in python. Is it realistic to imagine that they might rescind the offer or something like that when they see that not only am I still having to search for syntax basics (and in a language as simple as python, no less), but also that I'm doing lots of searching and struggling to understand some of the more abstract CS stuff in the problems?

I must have put in 50 different queries to google just trying to figure out how the hell I could do arithmetic on non-decimal number bases, and even then it eventually took my friend giving me a little nudge in the right direction informationally for me to actually figure out what I needed to do.

I really think that even if I somehow make it all the way to the interview, there's no chance they would hire me due to my lack of skill, but I want to try and get all the way through the challenge just for the fun of it.

Is it realistic to imagine that they might rescind the offer or something like that when they see that not only am I still having to search for syntax basics (and in a language as simple as python, no less), but also that I&amp;#39;m doing lots of searching and struggling to understand some of the more abstract CS stuff in the problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have put in 50 different queries to google just trying to figure out how the hell I could do arithmetic on non-decimal number bases, and even then it eventually took my friend giving me a little nudge in the right direction informationally for me to actually figure out what I needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think that even if I somehow make it all the way to the interview, there&amp;#39;s no chance they would hire me due to my lack of skill, but I want to try and get all the way through the challenge just for the fun of it. I don&amp;#39;t want to have the offer taken away from me before I get the chance to try my hand at all of the challenges. Am I overthinking this, or should I maybe be using duckduckgo for my problem-solving queries?&lt;/p&gt;

The challenge is to find an `input_string` which when applied the function SHA-256, generates an output that contains the string *b00da* (all hex valid characters, which kind of spell the name of the company: Buda).

So, basically:

    sha_256(input?) -&gt; xxxx-xxxx-b00da-xxxx

Can you write a function that finds such input? A valid output is for example:

359,,learnprogramming,"So I have been developing applications in MVVM for the most part. However, there are scenarios where I get confused whether MVVM architecture would be a good fit. As an example, I am developing a library that can be used to access some popular online service.

I have submitted a two examples of an authentication functionality. Note that this is all pseudo-code (I literally write this using Notepad++)

* I have an example using MVVM architecture.
* I have an example without using MVVM architecture. 
* I will first post each of the code, then I will comment it.

# Here is with MVVM architecture:

    namespace Model
    {
    	public class Session
    	{

    		{
    			// Implementation code that returns Model.Session
    		}
    		
    		public Model.Session ReauthenticateUsingRefreshToken(string refreshToken)
    		{
    			// Implementation code that (re)authenticates using refresh token
    		}

    	public class MainUIWindow

    		{
    			ViewModel.Auth auth = new ViewModel.Auth();

    			ViewModel.Auth auth = new ViewModel.Auth();
    			_currentAuthSession = auth.ReauthenticateUsingRefreshToken(_currentAuthSession.RefreshToken);
    		}
    	}
    }

# Here is the code without MVVM:

    namespace Auth
    {
    	public class Session
    	{
    		public string AccessToken { get { return _accessToken; } }
    		public string RefreshToken { get { return _refreshToken; } }
    		
    		public Create(string username, string password)
    		{
    			// Implementation to create a new session.
    		}
    		
    		public bool TryReauthenticateSession()
    		{
    			// Implementation to attempt to reauthenticate session using refresh token.
    		}
    	}
    }

    		}
    		
    		public void btnReauthenticate_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    		{
    			bool IsReauthenticationSuccess = _currentAuthSession.TryReauthenticateSession();
    			
    			// The logic continues here.
    		}
    	}
    }

Let's talk about a few things:

# Namespace/class names:

* First option uses MVVM. The naming is horrible. For the implementation, it uses ViewModel.Auth in terms of naming. 
* For non-MVVM, it uses Auth.Session. This looks so much cleaner. It is understandable that the classes stored under the Auth namespace would be related to authentication.

# Properties:

* The MVVM example has properties hosted in the Model.Session class. They have getters and setters. That allows the ViewModel to set the values. However, now it allows anyone else who access to the instance of Model.Session object to modify those properties. There is risks of bugs popping up because of that.
   * The workaround is to create a constructor that sets those values. It works fine if there is a small amount of properties. Once it starts adding up, the constructor will become huge. Unit tests will be more annoying to write too.
* The non-MVVM example is perfect. They are located in the same class that contains the authentication logic. That class has direct access to those properties, which allows them to contain getters only. If those properties need to be modified, only that class can modify it.

# Methods/functions:

* The MVVM example returns an instance of Model.Session class. Whoever is interacting with that object will expect that they can refresh the session by interacting with that object (e.g. \_currentSession.RefreshSession). Yet, since it is pointing to a Model, there is no implementation, so they have to go back to the instance of the ViewModel.Auth object and invoke something like \_auth.ReauthenticateUsingRefreshToken(\_currentSession.RefreshToken). It is so messy with having two objects for session/authentication.
* Looking at the second example, it so much cleaner. We create an instance of Auth.Session, which takes the username and password parameters (I know I can improve this, but this is pseudo-code). After that instance is created (e.g. \_currentSession), whenever the session expired and the user wants to reauthenticate, they can easily reauthenticate using the same object (instead of having another object). All they will now do is use \_currentSession.TryReauthenticateSession().

&amp;#x200B;

364,,learnprogramming,"Hi,

I'm trying to create an admin space. I'm trying to make my php relatively reusable, as of common standars, which avoids quite a lot of direct control over HTML source... So I have to create an ""edit.php"" page and I can't use things like `echo '&lt;input type=""radio"" id=""foo"" name=""foobar"" value=""bar"" {$checked}&gt;';` .

My forms are each contained in two files : the HTML form and a php file that contains an array listing all fields, their maximum value, if they're optional or not etc. and their SQL table and field name. That allows me to use a single page to parse and send all my forms and that seems to be a quite powerful solution as far as I know.

But as things weren't complicated enough, my forms are each built relatively to their needs ; like, I have one that has textareas which you can edit only if a checkbox is checked. So, when filling the form with content from mysql, if these textareas contain anything, the checkbox shall be checked as well.

The thing is, I could create a script that gets JSON data inside the appropriated fields but all this single-parser thing is useless if I have to write a JS script for every form. This is getting really messy...

&amp;#x200B;

TBH, I already discussed this here, I don't really like OO paradigms and this idea of creating swiss-army-knive scripts and this reminds me of some articles that I red with the author telling that he didn't like OO because he though that the cleanest way to perform a task was to write a custom script...

372,,learnprogramming,"Hello!


I have some code where I used **if** and **else if** because it was 5 lines of code as opposed to like 15 of properly formatted switch statement code. 


And I declare variables in those if-else statements, so that means that if they aren't true (which should literally never happen), then the thing that gets the variables will get an undefined or null or error or whatever. 


Sooo, what should I do? Declare the variables outside of the statement and waste 3 lines for an error, which if it happenned, would frick-up much more than those lines not getting the values they need. 



I dunno. I feel like you will tell me to take all safety precautions, even over the top because you never know. But I dunno. if I can't trust the code to execute line-by line like I have told it, then I dunno what we are doing here. Might as well abort the whole app at that point, even if I ever thought of making a check if everything is allright.



Example code:  

    function myfunction(id, type) {
        if (type == ""button"") {  
          var a = ""css_class11"";  
          var b = ""css_class12"";  
        } else if (type == ""link"") {  
          var a = ""css_class21"";   
          var b = ""css_class22"";  
        }   
          
        if (something) {

374,,learnprogramming,"I jumped into the software engineering world from the Javascript/Typescript side. So far I've been developing custom apps at companies but not from scratch:

* frontend was usually some SPA framework (I can happily work with React &amp; Vue and not so happily with Angular)
* backend was NodeJS, essentially a ""custom framework"" meaning Express/Koa and lots of custom glue code that other more opinionated frameworks would abstract away.

More and more work opportunities come up, people ask me about project work etc.

One possible project is basically a mini-ERP software with some data models, forms etc. I don't know many details about the scope (so it could vary from a focused app with only a few entities and forms to full-fledged whatever monster app to be integrated into an existing architecture) but it'll probably be pretty CRUD-focused and I would like to be prepared with development approaches once I consult directly with the client.

I've been looking around for some *opinionated* NodeJS backend frameworks which would help me with developing such apps with probably an MVC/MVT approach (so not REST API + SPA). After some research I see that today we have [Loopback](https://loopback.io/), [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/), [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as some popular alternatives. They all have some different approaches but are all NodeJS backend frameworks.

**My question:**

Given that I'm adept at JS, I could easily start development in any of the above frameworks. But for these kind of monolithic MVC apps, other languages and frameworks are even more popular. 

**How much should I look into learning** ***other languages*** **to access and use some of their more (often insanely) popular frameworks?** 

Some ideas:

* Python - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is insanely popular and hailed as having a great dev experience. I know basic Python and it really is a simple language but I have never developed in it for business use.
* Ruby - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is also often endorsed, but I rarely hear of Ruby outside of this framework nowadays.
* PHP - Symfony/[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) are *insanely* popular and they literally run half of the web (okay, I'm exaggerating but PHP is very widespread). The age of PHP is not over yet - but should I just start getting into it in 2020?

I know that this is partially based on project scope, expectations etc. But the main question is, can these frameworks give *so much more* in terms of DX, robustness, extensibility that it's worth getting into a new language for them?

* Compare PNG, JPG, and SVG image formats.
* Explain CORS.
* What are CSS Sprites?
* What's Functional Programming? 
* What's Object Oriented Programming?

As far as coding challenges go, most of the time I've had repo's or zip files sent to me with a ReadMe on what needed to be done. Usually those have been connecting some API and building the front-end for it. I did have one where they sent me a link to a website and said to build a similar one. I've also had someone sent me a testing file and said to fix the tests. 

For my two live coding challenges, I had one where I was asked to use a data-attribute in an html file, align something with CSS flexbox, and fix a js file (The error was with the this keyword). The other was building a todo list from scratch.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare PNG, JPG, and SVG image formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain CORS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are CSS Sprites?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s Functional Programming? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s Object Oriented Programming?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as coding challenges go, most of the time I&amp;#39;ve had repo&amp;#39;s or zip files sent to me with a ReadMe on what needed to be done. Usually those have been connecting some API and building the front-end for it. I did have one where they sent me a link to a website and said to build a similar one. I&amp;#39;ve also had someone sent me a testing file and said to fix the tests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my two live coding challenges, I had one where I was asked to use a data-attribute in an html file, align something with CSS flexbox, and fix a js file (The error was with the this keyword). The other was building a todo list from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those last two paragraphs are really just stating what I&amp;#39;ve been given in challenges/coding tasks to give you an idea of what to potentially prepare on doing. If anyone&amp;#39;s curious, I can share links to some of these repos/challenges. I always save them and if it&amp;#39;s something I can&amp;#39;t do at that time, it&amp;#39;s a good task for me to learn from completing on my own time.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been working in retail and warehouse jobs, I have a high school diploma and only about one year of community college.  The only computer experience that I have is basic Windows, MS Word, and MS Excel.

The main reason why I want a career change now is that my body cannot handle physical labor anymore.

My plan is to be a self-taught web developer. I have purchased a course from Udemy called Modern HTML and CSS from the Beginning (including Sass) from Brad Traversy about a year ago, and I also subscribe on my YouTube channel to freecodecamp and Traversy Media.

My goal is to learn HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, and Python.  Can anyone recommend which other programmer languages I should also learn to be able to reach my goal of becoming a web developer? My goal is to spend about 15 hours per week on learning, and I hope I could get a job in two or three years.

But what I am doubting this right now, is because of my age and lack of experience in the computer world that the employer won’t hire me.

And when I went to YouTube to research a web developer, I find two or three-channel that said that you could find a job in about a year.  So, is that true or false?

Thanks

403,,learnprogramming,"Hey guys, first of all thanks for taking the time with my post.

Six months ago I decided to start learning to code. I'm 36, been working in the IT for a decade or so but in a more technical role. For me it's not only time to make a change, I'm already too late so I have the feeling all the time that I need to hurry, but, free time is not really there. So, I'm constantly trying to find an hour here, half an hour there and study.

So, to get to the point, I started the path with html + css which went good and then started getting into javascript. And then... Block! I'm using mainly udemy courses in which although I find most of the guys amazing and really feel they know what they are saying, this type of learning isn't really for me. You do endless series of videos with theory but no training at the same time. 

I'm more of a try-it-yourself learner. So after watching  a series of prototype + primitive + objects + functions + closures + blocks + iifes + maps + + + + nothing really sinks in. 

Ok maps are great. Where am I going to use them? How? Why should I? Nothing..

I'm looking for a means of learning where I do something along, where I learn by example and coding my self. I've come up project Odin and I guess I really need to hear that maybe that is the right way for me to go.

I can either implement it as a method of the users class, or I can create a independent function. How do I decide which of them is a better approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is around a thousand lines of code right now and I think there will be a few more thousand lines of code before it finishes, so if anyone can suggest a code organisation/ directory structure for the database related code, it will be nice. For the flask code, I am separating it in blueprints right now, and if you have other suggestions, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m looking to learn and get some clarification on what “optimizing your website” for SEO really means programming wised.

Is this phrase just a marketing term for non technical people or is the whole SEO thing something really technical that many developer outsource to a dedicated 3rd party?

I couldn’t find much info online beside being bombarded with SEO providers ads in my search results.

Does SEO just mean putting your sites content within the correct HTML tags?

Navigation bar under Nav tag, your main content under the main tag, breaking sites into section tags etc instead of using a ton of divs?

And when using a div or id name them with “key” words?

This is my first post on Reddit, so hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.  I am struggling in my programming concepts class.  (To be fair, I am a math major, not computer science)  I have to make a speedometer program.

This is the original description:

This time you are going to create a speedometer calculator. Below is the formula and some basic logic about why this is important. In this program you will ask the user for the tire sizes (old &amp; new). Then you will calculate the difference between the actual speed of the vehicle and what the speedometer shows in 10 mph increments from 10-100. You will save all of actual speeds in an array. For example and using the ratio difference below, at 60 mph on the speedometer the actual speed of the vehicle is 66 mph. so you will store the actual speed in the array of 66 mph. For the display, see the picture below. Oh yeah, don’t forget about giving the user the ability to run the program as many times as they want, again like in the picture below.

Where I am stuck is the array part.  I have been trying all day but it does not make sense to me.

I am currently in my first employment, it is a very small company that wants me to create a program to fill a niche in our local market. I am the sole developer. My boss wants the program to be protected via license keys but he wants as little maintenance for the project once it is done as possible so he doesn't want to have an actual system where the entered key is checked for validity against a server. 

He wants me to create some algorithm that checks the keys according to specific criteria, just like credit card numbers are ""validated"" because of calculations with that number that have to reach a specific result. I am supposed to write both the key generator for the website, that sends the user a key that will be syntactically valid for the checker and the checker in the program that verifies that a key is syntactically valid.  


My question is how do I even begin to come up with such an algorithm myself?

My boss doesn't care that this way of licensing the program is easily overcome and cracked, he just wants it to be hard enough so the common user won't bother trying to crack it. (due to the nature of the program the target audience is, for the most part, pretty much tech-illiterate)

Others are more towards marketing and say they've scraped and collected a ton of data and can help tell you exactly what users want (whatever that means...?). Then there's websites like trivago/kayak or similar things that just act as aggregators of other websites to help find you the ""best deal"".

It's been a while since I've had a question that is bothering me a lot. It is likely that this post is going to lengthen a little, I really appreciate those who take the time to read it and help me. (Also my native language is not english, sorry about spelling mistakes.) I will clarify my definition of success below.

This is the matter:

I´m 19 years old. I live in Argentina. I finished high school in 2018. In 2019 I started studying a career (informatics engineering) but I left it in the middle of that year, because I didn´t like that career that much. I knew that I wanted to study something related to computers and technology, but it wasn´t that. (let's clarify that college in Argentina is free).

I spent the other half of the year looking for something to spend my time on, since until this 2020 I couldn't start another career, but I didn´t find anything. A few days ago, I found a course on Udemy about full stack development, and I started it. I really liked it, and I realized that programming would be something that I could dedicate myself to. That made me very happy.

But here´s the problem. First, In Argentina there are no careers on programming, only some distance courses that do not teach more than one particular language and last only a few months, or the systems analyst career, but that doesn't interest me too much. Also, I don't like college, I prefer a lot more learning on my own.  
But I don´t know if an Udemy course can give me the succes I want. And what´s success for me?

Well, first I want to leave Argentina. I like this place less and less. Insecurity goes up, the economy goes down. All the time like that. I would like to live in a country of Europe like Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, or in the USA.  
Then, it is not a mandatory requirement, but something I would like very much is working from home (or somewhere like a coffee shop), and that this allows me to travel a few times a year.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don´t know if an Udemy course can give me the succes I want

Returning to this, you think that with this udemy course, could I be taken in some internships, and thus be able to be hired, to be able to move to another place? (sorry, I can't think another way to write this)

What would be your recommendation or life advice?

443,,learnprogramming,"I saw a lecture recently where the speaker mentioned a university class she took where they learned 4 different languages (one at a time) by solving the same projects in each language. She said it was a freshman or sophomore class but it was the most impactful class she ever took, and that it was significant she took it early before really falling in love with any one language.

The point was that it trained someone to think in terms of problem solving BEFORE learning to think in terms of a specific language and the habits and mindset that doing so reinforces.

I want to make a similar class for myself, with C++ and either JavaScript or Python. Maybe I’ll publish the curriculum as a series on YouTube or something afterwards.

So my question is, what “things” do I focus on learning that are common to all languages? Things that can be learned with absolute beginner level projects, and without having to spend too much time learning how to set things up for one specific language or use case. I’m not trying to master programming with one class, just to relatively quickly (a few weeks at 30-40hrs/wk) learn ABOUT programming BY PROGRAMMING and by separating the force of habit from the concepts themselves.

She said it was a freshman or sophomore class but it was the most impactful class she ever took, and that it was significant she took it early before really falling in love with any one language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point was that it trained someone to think in terms of problem solving BEFORE learning to think in terms of a specific language and the habits and mindset that doing so reinforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make a similar class for myself, with C++ and either JavaScript or Python. Maybe I’ll publish the curriculum as a series on YouTube or something afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, what “things” do I focus on learning that are common to all languages? Things that can be learned with absolute beginner level projects, and without having to spend too much time learning how to set things up for one specific language or use case. I’m not trying to master programming with one class, just to relatively quickly (a few weeks at 30-40hrs/wk) learn ABOUT programming BY PROGRAMMING and by separating the force of habit from the concepts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

Before my symptoms flared, I used a shotgun approach: I would open up Chrome in the console and type line by line to see the effects. Now that I can't type, I find it extremely unnerving that I can't test the syntax and just extremely frustrating in general. I thought about just quitting, thinking that it wasn't meant to be, but now I have some real alternatives.

Should I write out my code in an iPad Pro for instance so I actually know the syntax before using voice command shortcuts? Before my symptoms flared, I used a shotgun approach: I would open up Chrome in the console and type line by line to see the effects. Now that I can&amp;#39;t type, I find it extremely unnerving that I can&amp;#39;t test the syntax and just extremely frustrating in general. I thought about just quitting, thinking that it wasn&amp;#39;t meant to be, but now I have some real alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had similar experiences? Does anyone here program primarily by voice? I guess I&amp;#39;m looking for any insights or advice or inspiration for a beginner learner with real skin in the game (I know what I need to do, I don&amp;#39;t have lots of time, and I know that the job market is brutal for entry-level positions, especially for people with no technical experience).&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a W3Schools example of adding text, but not in an expandable button. https://www.w3schools.com/csS/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_buttons_animate1  
It uses the same element and appends text to span basically. I find it very confusing.

So I made my own, in my own usercase, and tried to use the examples above. This is what I got:



https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GB034S9TMY0X


Basically, my text element with opacity 0 exists in time and space, and it's just invisible, so it pushes the image. This should not happen. The image should be standing nicely in the dead center in one single line. And when you hover, the button expands, and the text appears. 


I tried to make everything inline-block in hopes that they will actually be inthe same line since there is only supposed to be one line ,and all the content centered. And I tried to make the parent button overflow so the text at least dissappears if it can't be shown in the same line. But it didn't work.


________________________________________________


UPDATE:

I just remembered that flex naturally doesn't show items that are outside the borders, so I tried it:


https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GB03F0WM3MZR


Now it looks much more like it should, and align-items puts them in the center which is nice.


But justify-content looks good only when expanded. I suspect it takes into account the invisible text. Justify-items does nothing.

I think we are near the solution. I just hope you can give me that last push. And tell me how to do this correctly.

&lt;p&gt;my problem is that I can&amp;#39;t have more than one bullet on the screen, as pressing the spacebar resets the x and y positions of the bullet. So everytime i press the spacebar the bullet fires, but pressing it a second time causes the bullet to disappear and reappear wherever your current position is. So how can I make it so that i can draw multiple bullets at once regardless of how many times i press the spacebar? heres my code for reference&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; [Gramps-devel] Google Summer of Code
&gt; 
&gt; From: Nick Hall &lt;nick-h@gr...&gt; - 2020-01-24 16:04:22
&gt; 
&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone interested in participating in the Google Summer of Code?
&gt; 
&gt; ""Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.""
&gt; 
&gt; https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com
&gt; 
&gt; As an organisation we meet the requirements of being open source and have released a product.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to participate we would need two organisation administrators and at leat one mentor.  Details of these roles can be found here:
&gt; 
&gt; https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially the mentor needs to be a developer who has knowledge of the code, and the administrators just need organisational skills.  A mentor can also be an organisation administrator.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is any interest I can write an ideas list.  We could always use someone to write a new visualisation for example, but any other ideas are welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; The deadline for organisations to sign up is 5th February, so we need to act quickly if we are interested.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are a student reading this, and would like to do some work for us, please also reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Nick,

I'm super new to programming. Just started learning through an online course (CS50).

There's an exercise in this course where you write a program (in C) in which you ask the user for a number between 1 and 8, and then a pyramid of hashes is displayed according to that number. So if they type 3, something like the following should appear:

        #
       ##
      ###
And if they type 5, it should display:

           #
          ##
         ###
        ####
       #####


I didn't figure out how to do it. Here's my code:

    int main(void)
    {
        int n;

        do {
            n = get_int(""Height: "");
        }
        while (n &lt; 1  || n &gt; 8);
    
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        {      
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
                {
                    printf(""#"");
                }
             printf(""\n"");
         }
    }

At this point, if the user types 8, it only displays the following:

    ########
    ########
    ########
    ########
    ########
    ########
    ########
    ########

I couldn't find out how to make it pyramid-like. So I looked it up online, and saw that to achieve the desired effect, someone simply added the following lines inside the nested *for loop*:

    if (i + j &lt; n - 1)
        printf("" "");

That solves it. The problem is that I have no idea why that works. I don't understand the formula/arithmetic behind it. Why does **i + j  &lt; n - 1** produce such an effect? It's too cryptic for me. I see that it prints spaces instead of hashes if that condition is met, but I can't follow the reasoning behind it. Can you help me understand that, maybe explaining like I'm five?

Below is the full solved code:

    int main(void)
    {
        int n;

        do {
      
                n = get_int(""Height: "");
            }

        while (n &lt; 1  || n &gt; 8);
  
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
            {
                 
                for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
                   {

                       if (i + j &lt; n - 1)
                       printf("" "");

                      else
                         printf(""#"");
                    }
                printf(""\n"");

I&amp;#39;ll leave this as it is and call it quits for the time being. I spent too much time looking at this and feel like I should&amp;#39;ve understood it by now. But I didn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m quite frustrated, impatience is growing, so I can&amp;#39;t really make sense of what you guys are saying (this is all on me). Maybe I&amp;#39;m too dumb for programing. I understand the pattern and everything, but I can&amp;#39;t comprehend why I should add i+j. I&amp;#39;ll watch the new lectures and try to tackle this at a better time, then review this thread. Right now I can&amp;#39;t look at this no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m super new to programming. Just started learning through an online course (CS50).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an exercise in this course where you write a program (in C) in which you ask the user for a number between 1 and 8, and then a pyramid of hashes is displayed according to that number. So if they type 3, something like the following should appear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    #
   ##
  ###
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if they type 5, it should display:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t figure out how to do it. Here&amp;#39;s my code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main(void)
{
    int n;

    do {
        n = get_int(&amp;quot;Height: &amp;quot;);
    }
    while (n &amp;lt; 1  || n &amp;gt; 8);

    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++)
    {      
        for (int j = 0; j &amp;lt; n; j++)
            {
                printf(&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;);
            }
         printf(&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;);
     }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, if the user types 8, it only displays the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;########
########
########
########
########
########
########
########
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find out how to make it pyramid-like. So I looked it up online, and saw that to achieve the desired effect, someone simply added the following lines inside the nested &lt;em&gt;for loop&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (i + j &amp;lt; n - 1)
    printf(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That solves it. The problem is that I have no idea why that works. I don&amp;#39;t understand the formula/arithmetic behind it. Why does &lt;strong&gt;i + j  &amp;lt; n - 1&lt;/strong&gt; produce such an effect? It&amp;#39;s too cryptic for me. I see that it prints spaces instead of hashes if that condition is met, but I can&amp;#39;t follow the reasoning behind it. Can you help me understand that, maybe explaining like I&amp;#39;m five?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the full solved code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main(void)
{
    int n;

    do {

            n = get_int(&amp;quot;Height: &amp;quot;);
        }

    while (n &amp;lt; 1  || n &amp;gt; 8);

    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++)
        {

            for (int j = 0; j &amp;lt; n; j++)
               {

                   if (i + j &amp;lt; n - 1)
                   printf(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;);

                  else
                     printf(&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;);
                }
            printf(&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;);
       }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay so this app is a basic encryption program. The user enters a word (lowercase) and a shift amount (integer). The program then shifts each letter of the word up by the numerical amount entered. I only want characters a-z to be dealt with so there are instances where the character will need to wrap back. For example: 'z' gets shifted 4 should = 'd'

I am able to compile, but the shift does not stay within the a-z parameters.

     [""item1"", ""item2"", ""item3"",.. , ""item n-1""]

Because I'm using a lot of strings in the .txt file, when when I go to make my Python script, I can easily copy the line of text it creates and use it to initialize an array.

Here's the code:

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;fstream&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    using namespace std;
    
    int main()
    {

       newfile.open(""blocklist.txt"",ios::in); //Opens my .txt file and reads it
       
       if (newfile.is_open())
       {   
            string python; //Creates a string everything goes to
    	  
            cout &lt;&lt; ""[\""""; //Starts line like this- ""[python 1
    	    
            while(getline(newfile, python))

            }
    	//Include code for when it finishes completing
            newfile.close(); //Closes the file.
        }
    }

Unfortunately, the result I constantly get is:

    ], [Yellow Wool], [taass Panerste

Although ""Yellow Wool"" is the last string in the txt file, it's supposed to print everything else before it.

I am making a multi-d array inside an object (to save as json). 


So, in order to minimize the already large chance of errors in a volatile system, it is imperative that array_length works flawlessly, and that I can fetch and display non-content, or not fetch and not display lack of content. 



So, if I have 


|ID|Name|Surname|Address|Comment|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|Steve||420, Weed St. ||
|2||Johnes|||
|3|Jerry|Jerrymeier||Banana|
|4|Terry||||


I wanna know which of these will do what I want:


    obj = {  
        tables: {  
            table1: {   
                headers: [ ""ID"", ""Name"", ""Surname"", ""Address"", ""Comment"" ],
                content: [

                ]
            }  
        }
    }  



1. Which value should I use for cells where there is no content? (I guess it would matter if you wrote """", but all the indexes were integers, and you did math on them, so there's something to consider).


2. Am I allowed to go deep, deep with arrays? Since I can't name tables dynamically, each table would be an index of an index, and in another index, there would be table content in a 2d array, so we are already 3-4 layers deep at the start. I am sure I can make it work. The question is whether you think this is good form. (I know about databases, but I want to use json for this, so let's just focus on the questions at hand)

599,,learnprogramming,"Hi,

I'm a sophomore computer science student, minoring in math. I've been teaching myself how to code in python and Java on my own since I was  a freshman in high school. At this point, I have  a few small projects under my belt, implementing different concepts I've learned  (i.e file I/O, Object oriented programming, different sorting algorithms, and some small python modules like Kivy). I also recently finished a project over winter break, where I made a calculator that accepted/parses normal expressions ( ""6\*(2+1)"") and calculated the result. I've also worked very briefly with html/css/Js. All of these projects I've worked on outside of class.

I'm explaining these projects because I don't really know where I should be going from here. Right now, I'm mostly just working through problems on [HackerRank.com](https://HackerRank.com) in my spare time. My question is, how do I continue to develop my skills? I'm at the point where I'm comfortable with basic programming concepts, but haven't explored a lot of the different modules/built-in methods python or Java have to offer. 

There's so many different online learning resources, and different opinions about where to start, I'm in a bit of an information freeze. Should I be trying to learn a stack? Just working on larger projects? Open-source projects (I'm terrible at reading other people's code, but trying to improve)? I see a lot of new programmers learning web development. What if I want to stick with python or Java?

This realization came out of my quest for finding a way to center divs inside a css-grid.

Finally, I found that:  



    align-self: center;  
    justify-self:center;  


work without a problem. 



I was happy with it, until I realized that I used those two lines in literally every child of the grid wrapper element. So I tried the obvious solution and tried to use the parent commands:


    align-content: center;  
    justify-content:center;  



and it didn't work at all.



Now, I do realize that these are basically flex-commands because most of the documentation insinuates that. But I do hope that using it in a css grid is legit. At least the child commands, and that I can at least make a class if I don't find some other way to center stuff. 



Margins are so volatile and flimsy and you have the age old problem of vertical units being linked to horizontal ones, so I wanted to avoid that entirely. 



Do you have some advice for me? What should I do?

I live in a side campus of a national university.

The campus needs some upgrades, here is my plan:

The cafe employs a system where you buy stuff and simply write a bill that piles up for you in the account books. At the end of month, you get a consolidated bill and you pay cash at the end of month not before.

The plan is to digitize this, it will cover around 4-5 cafes and a 2 more shops.

Main panels:

\&gt;User enter details (ID, Pin(like an ATM pin), amount he is to be billed for).

\&gt;Admin panel where you see all pending and previous bills, monthly sorted

&lt;p&gt;The cafe employs a system where you buy stuff and simply write a bill that piles up for you in the account books. At the end of month, you get a consolidated bill and you pay cash at the end of month not before.&lt;/p&gt;

629,,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is an appropriate question for this sub. 

I do some programming but I'm mostly on the operations side of a small company and we have a couple other programmers, but neither really has experience setting up scheduled scripts.

In addition to the hundreds of files we receive a week, process and upload to our own DB, we have a few clients that are now requiring us to send various daily, weekly, and monthly files that we create by pulling data from a back-end database and run some logic and formatting in python. These files are then manually placed on an SFTP. 

Now that were sending 40+ files a week with potentially much more in the future, I think we really need to get a centralized way of managing these file transfers on a schedule so I've been looking into solutions that can scale. 

I've looked into Apache Airflow, Luigi, RunDeck, and StackStorm which seem like they could do the job and scale well, but also might be overkill for what were doing. Plus, I'm hesitant with something complex since no one in the company has experiencing managing something like Airflow.

At the same time, I want to avoid having 100+ separate scripts that are all over the place and  and on random schedules. I should also mention that a lot of the Python code needs regular updating and bug fixes so I could see it becoming a nightmare to maintain.

Are there any software solutions that I'm missing? Or best practices to create a custom scheduler? Or does it sound like Airflow (or one of it's alternatives) would be the best fit?

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is an appropriate question for this sub. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do some programming but I&amp;#39;m mostly on the operations side of a small company and we have a couple other programmers, but neither really has experience setting up scheduled scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the hundreds of files we receive a week, process and upload to our own DB, we have a few clients that are now requiring us to send various daily, weekly, and monthly files that we create by pulling data from a back-end database and run some logic and formatting in python. These files are then manually placed on an SFTP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that were sending 40+ files a week with potentially much more in the future, I think we really need to get a centralized way of managing these file transfers on a schedule so I&amp;#39;ve been looking into solutions that can scale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve looked into Apache Airflow, Luigi, RunDeck, and StackStorm which seem like they could do the job and scale well, but also might be overkill for what were doing. Plus, I&amp;#39;m hesitant with something complex since no one in the company has experiencing managing something like Airflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I want to avoid having 100+ separate scripts that are all over the place and  and on random schedules. I should also mention that a lot of the Python code needs regular updating and bug fixes so I could see it becoming a nightmare to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any software solutions that I&amp;#39;m missing? Or best practices to create a custom scheduler? Or does it sound like Airflow (or one of it&amp;#39;s alternatives) would be the best fit?&lt;/p&gt;

636,,learnprogramming,"Hello, I was wondering, in general, how one could go about finding recurrence relations for dynamic programming problems. 

In general, most of the videos I've seen so far involving dynamic programming have in some way described the algorithmic process that the code goes through in order to determine the answer, but I've found those videos somewhat lacking in terms of how they derive actual recurrence relations from those board-drawn algorithms. I know that, for many cases involving ""total combinations"" problems, people usually try to go through some sort of backtracking solution first in order to list out all those combinations, and then later derive the minimum from the entire answer set. Then they would try to memoize the backtracking method to bring each new item into the array itself, so as to reduce runtime. However, when encountering a problem such as LC 322, I've found some solutions a bit too elegant to arrive to from those other methods. For instance, this example:

&gt; You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money _amount_. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Solution:


    public void minCoins(int[] coins, int amount){
        int[] vals = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(vals, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        vals[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; amount; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; coins.length; j++){
                if (coins[j] &lt;= i)
                    vals[i] = Math.min(vals[i], vals[i - coins[j]] + 1);
            }
        }
        return vals[amount] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : vals[amount];
    }

From here, it's easy to see that their main recurrence relation is just:

    vals[i] = Math.min(vals[i], vals[i - coins[j]] + 1);

This seems like something that should have popped right out immediately though, right from the question, _without_ having to go through some sort of backtracking garbage. I want to be able to derive solutions like this quickly and without too much strain (as will inevitably happen during an interview), and I was wondering if someone could explain how to do this for other problems?

675,,learnprogramming,"I've been trying to automate the process of:

1. Generating a key that is added to the ""known\_hosts"" file to authenticate a server's IP address
2. SCP'ing a modified sshd\_config file onto the server to allow passwordless RSA-key-based login
3. SCP'ing a bash script onto the server to run the ""apt-get"" commands and similar.
4. Logging into that server and running the bash script.

Steps 2 and 4 utilize .vbs scripts to get around the security procedures and allow interaction with both the local and remote shells.

When I undergo this process step-by-step using the Python shell, I have no problems, and the server boots up as intended.  When I put all of the commands into a class method within a module, however, it almost always hangs up if I try to do anything past step 2.

At first I thought maybe the first scp command was being initiated before the remote host was added to the ""known\_hosts"" file, but after adding `time.sleep(x)` to my script and giving it more than enough time to generate, it would still hang up.

I started by using the [`subprocess.run`](https://subprocess.run)`(cmd,` `shell=True)` method for all commands.  When that would hang up, I tried changing `bufsize` to `0`. 

I also tried using the `proc_obj = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)` constructor as well as the `proc_obj.wait()` and `proc_obj.communicate()` methods with no success.

The furthest I got was by using the `proc_obj.wait()` method, which (unreliably) succeeded through step 3 but still hung up (on step 2) when step 4 was included in the script.

I checked the .vbs scripts, and they are exactly the same as if I did the whole process manually.  I have put more than enough time between each process using the `time.sleep(x)` method.

I'll be completing my Bachelors  in Environmental Engineering in a few  months. I've decided to pursue a career in CS.

I  have limited programming experience. I know Python and basic SQL  through the ""Python for Everybody"" specialization on Coursera. I had to take an introductory C  programming course as part of my undergraduate program. And know basic java through an  online course, that covered the basics of object oriented programming, algorithms and data structures. I also know some MATLAB through  university courses.

I'm planning to pursue a Masters in CS soon so I need to make up for prerequisites:  sufficient knowledge of  programming, data structures and algorithms, computer architecture and  theory of computation. In addition they want people proficient in C, C++  or Java.  

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted an opinion on which resource(s) I should use to cover up the knowledge gap, and improve my programming to a point where I can be hired as an intern/trainee in a software firm.

The biggest thing i hear people say is that ""you can't learn programming by watching programming videos just like you can't learn to play the pianno by watching someone play it"" witch is a hilarious false equivalency.

I don't use them as a means to learn programming only with them. I don't watch a ""learn x in y hours"" or ""x crash course"" video to come out of it claiming i'm a proffesional at x, or that i even have a solid foundation for that matter.

Over the last month or two, I've been spending a ton of time on Udemy and Youtube learning everything I can about Python. I'm excited because I feel that I've gotten a comfortable with a lot of the *core* syntax and functions, which were absolutely terrifying in the start  (progress!).

When I say core, I mean very basic operations and objects.

My problem is, as I move forward, I can't seem to find very many resources that move away from these topics. I see and hear all sorts of things on this sub and all over the internet that are practically a foreign language. APIs? No clue. Strings? I've watched about three hours of explanations on those. I'm ordering the Python Crash Course and Learn Python the Hard Way books, but even those worry me in that they may just be going over the same day 1 lessons.

As it states in the title I am wondering what process Web Developers go through when designing and making a website. Its is a general set of steps or does each developer follow there own process? What are some things to make the process easier and more manageable?

For example if you were tasked with completely redesigning a website, would you start from scratch or  would you copy the code from the original and use that as a starting point? 

If you started from scratch  would you write all the HTML, then go back and implement CSS, and then the Java Script?  Or would you write all the related code to a certain page or portion/functionality of a website such as a contact page and make sure it works before moving on to another section of the web page.

I'm aware a C# Auto Property creates a variable  as well as methods for the getter and setter. My understanding is that this is done by the compiler itself.

I've tried looking up for the following, but haven't had much success except [for one specific article](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/understanding-properties-in-C-Sharp/) on Properties.

&gt;In case of auto-implemented properties, the compiler creates a private  field variable that can only be accessed through the property's getter  and setter.

He's beign so specific with that ""In case of auto-implemented properties..."" that I'd like to check if creating a full property where you specify the logic of the setter and getter also creates a variable, although it's not being used.

For example, in this specific code does the Hours property create a variable under the hood?

    class TimePeriod
    {
       private double _seconds;
    
       public double Hours
       {
           get { return _seconds / 3600; }
           set { 
              if (value &lt; 0 || value &gt; 24)
                 throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(
                       $""{nameof(value)} must be between 0 and 24."");
    
              _seconds = value * 3600; 
           }
       }
    }

735,,learnprogramming,"So I was working on an android app, and I saw that all my repository functions had basically the same code. I tried to abstract the functionality out into a class, but I ended up with two (I edited the fromRemote function in each class out for brevity). As you can see both of these classes have basically the same code, except that one of them has a second type of generic class (Param) which is used for the fetch and read functions.

The fetch function (or variable) is used to fetch data from remote, the read function is to read it from local, and the write function is to write the new data to local. (The Intel class is included at the bottom)

It is written so that the local data is returned first, and then it's updated by the remote data... if there's a difference.

How can I combine these two classes? Because a lot of code is duplicate here.

I tried to abstract the functionality out into a class, but I ended up with two (I edited the fromRemote function in each class out for brevity). As you can see both of these classes have basically the same code, except that one of them has a second type of generic class (Param) which is used for the fetch and read functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fetch function (or variable) is used to fetch data from remote, the read function is to read it from local, and the write function is to write the new data to local. (The Intel class is included at the bottom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is written so that the local data is returned first, and then it&amp;#39;s updated by the remote data... if there&amp;#39;s a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I combine these two classes? Because a lot of code is duplicate here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I know that I run the suspend functions in sequence, but that&amp;#39;s a whole other question.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt; If you were using Entity Framework or another ORM, you already have objects, not database entities, so it doesn't matter if your objects are coming from web service or database directly. 

Sounds great! But how do I use those objects from one database in multiple projects in Visual Studio? I want to create a Web service, a Windows client and an Android client, all using the same database objects. The Web service will interact directly with the database, and the clients will interact with the Web service. All of them should share the same ""business objects"" which are ultimately built on the database tables.

So for example in the database there are tables for ""Account"", ""Transaction"", etc, and the Web service server application project will have the EntityFramework package added and I will use it to scaffold the database and create EF-generated classes ""Account"" and ""Transaction"".

How do I get access to those EF-generated classes from the client applications? I don't want to copy the code to multiple locations because of the maintenance nightmare if the database changes. Can I put them in a code library and access the library from all three applications or something?

The client applications shouldn't have to have the EntityFramework package added since they don't know about the database. They just need access to plain objects that they can send to the Web service.

I want to implement proper version control on this project using Git / GitHub. I've been coding for two years, but this will be my first time using version control (I know, I know...I suck).

The data directory mostly contains csv files, but does contain some binary files as well. It is currently around 200 MB and will continue to grow. Almost all of the data will change frequently, most of it daily. If I do include it in the GitHub repo, I would *not* need to use GitHub to track changes to the data files.

The repo will be private and I will be the only person accessing this project, but I do need it cloned on two machines; my primary laptop that I work on every day, and a laptop that lives in my office that will automatically run scripts overnight to retrieve fresh data for the data directory. Both laptops are on Windows 10.

On my primary laptop, the local version of the project lives in my synced Dropbox folder. The other laptop is not synced to my Dropbox account. 

As far as managing the data directory I'm considering two options...

1. Ignore the data directory in the repo and rely on Dropbox for the data files. Basically the laptop in my office would do all the data retrieval and cleanup that it needs to do at night, and then it would use an API key to upload all those data files to the project's data directory in Dropbox. Pros: When I fire up my primary laptop in the morning, fresh copies of all the data files I need will already be sitting there in the data directory. Cons: I have to leave my Dropbox API key on a machine that isn't always with me. That's not a huge security concern in my situation (nobody else in my organization even knows what an API key is, much less how to find and use one), but still. Also, for some reason it just seems weird that the project will look different in the GitHub repo than it does locally.
2. Include the data directory in the GitHub repo. Pros: Don't have to worry about my Dropbox API key. Everything with the project stays consistent everywhere. Cons: I'm assuming I'd have to pull the repo from my primary laptop every morning to access the updated data files? Can that be automated? Also, one of the data files is over 100 MB and will continue to grow, so I'd probably have to split that one up or something.

I modified df2's 'name' column to follow the (first initial, last name convention) of df1's 'short\_name' column. Unfortunately it led to many exceptions since df2's 'name' column doesn't always follow that convention (examples include, 'Neymar Jr' (expected: ""Neymar""), Cristiano Ronaldo (expected: C. Ronaldo), and Roberto Firmino (expected: R. Firmino).

The only other thing I can think of is using substring matching.

Is there a way to split df2's 'name' column into separate substrings and then see if df1's 'long\_name' contains all of those elements (ie seeing if ""Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini"" has both ""Lionel"" and  ""Messi"" from d1's name and then merging on it)?

After searching for a while, it doesn't seem like something in pandas functionality since it splits it into several columns. I also don't know if merges can take conditions like substring matches.

Everything I've thought of doesn't address these exceptions/non-matches except for substring matching. If there are any other ideas out there I would love to know. It's been a few days and I can't seem to get this.

Edit: Thanks to u/serg06, I was able to find something that works which required isolating and creating a copy of the columns (making them series) then splitting the names into lists and seeing if the shorter names were subsets of the longer names in a double for-loop. Here is my code:

I apologise in advance if the questions don't make much sense or if they have been answered before (I found somewhat relevant questions, but either didn't understand the answers or did not think they applied to my situation). Any guidance in this field or answers to the question would be extremely helpful.


Situation: We have a standalone app rolled out to customers, which uses AWS Userpools for user accounts.


Issue number 1, storing the AWS (and other) API keys: I've read around and quickly realised the most secure location to store them is server side. We have an FTP server set up currently used for auto updates which I assume can also be used for retrieving the API keys. Issue with this is that we still need to store the information to access the server somewhere securely. What would be the best approach for storing and accessing API keys on server side? Once API keys have been retrieved can we store them in memory to not have to access server again? Have I just completely misunderstood what they meant by handling it server side?

Issue Number 2, feature flags: Due to different pay levels we have implemented feature flags, these flags are retrieved from a database when connecting to the app online. However if they need to get on the app whilst offline they need to be stored locally in a way where they can not be modified. Is it safe enough to encrypt the data and store it in a file locally and decrypt it on app startup?

Issue Number 3, making sure the user is ok to use app if offline: As we want the user to not be able to log in after a set amount of days in offline mode without reconnecting I imagine I should be going down the route of using the AWS Userpool Tokens. How would one safely store these tokens to persist through app closure and is there any risk of storing them locally?

I have a quick question and i'm going to throw some background context at you.

I'm 22 years old, I graduated last year May with a B.S in computer science. Can i code? No? 

Can I understand a little bit, yes kind of. 

Did coding ever catch my attention, no because i was never able to understand it. I just couldn't understand the building blocks to code and design. 

Now, i'm currently a technology analyst.  I decided that I want to take a udemy course and fully learn coding. I'm stuck between java and javascript. I know they're both totally different languages. During school i had no exposure to JS but rather I had a lot of exposure to java. 

I read a lot of different things from Js is easier to learn but harder to master. Java is more classic with standard things. People ask me do i want to do front-end or back-end? I don't really know, does it really matter? I didn't experience 

Don't bash me for not learning in school, I shoud've learned and paid attention and really tried growing a passion for it. Better late than never. 

for a second I was leaning towards javascript because it might be easier to create mini project and i can build my self a portfolio, but again I can do the same thing with java. 

Please help me a make a decision that might impact my future. Thank you

So, previously , I've implemented oauth (facebook login) in a mobile app where the client gets a token back after authorizing the app (via the pop up thinggy) and I send that token to the backend and it calls the Facebook api and requests data  using that token, if it resolves, then the user us verified.

However, with discord, I'm a bit lost. the guide i was reading up on said i make a request to a route in my backend, which redirects the user to discord auth. And when that's completed, discord sends a response to the callback url (is that supposed to my rest api or front end??). If its the api, then how does the front end know that a callback was sent to my rest api? Do i need to implement sockets to to let the client know that the user has been authorised?

&lt;p&gt;So, previously , I&amp;#39;ve implemented oauth (facebook login) in a mobile app where the client gets a token back after authorizing the app (via the pop up thinggy) and I send that token to the backend and it calls the Facebook api and requests data  using that token, if it resolves, then the user us verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with discord, I&amp;#39;m a bit lost. the guide i was reading up on said i make a request to a route in my backend, which redirects the user to discord auth. And when that&amp;#39;s completed, discord sends a response to the callback url (is that supposed to my rest api or front end??). If its the api, then how does the front end know that a callback was sent to my rest api? Do i need to implement sockets to to let the client know that the user has been authorised? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just confused about callbacks with seperately hosted rest api and front end. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

787,,learnprogramming,"So hello, I'm new to reddit and I hope I'm posting this in the right place..

I have this project and I'm setting myself 3 to 5 years to complete it. So basically I want to make this add-on censor for the web, or an app for tablets and phones, that allows the user to define what they don't want to see and censor it automatically: blur it with a small discription at the bottom. Kind of like the nsfw blurs or the 'OMG this is a sensitive image' thingy blur on instagram where you kinda click at your own risk. I think its also on facebook but I'm not sure.

I want to use this technology on one side for people with phobias. For example if someone with a huge blood phobia wants to watch a horror or gorry movie on  lets say netflix, the scenes with blood would either be completely blacked out or blurred with automatic subtitles being put at the bottom and a small scene description, or if I can really go far with this project, only the part that the person doesn't want to see, in this case blood, would be cropped out. 

On the other hand, I also want to use it to censor full scenes in movies for smart TVs. For example on netflix, there are so many great series and movies that we can't watch together as a family with my parents and siblings. If only all the dirty scenes or gorry scenes would either get straight out skipped if they add nothing to the story or just blacked out with automatic subtitles put at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I mqde clear what the goal of this project is. As I said earlier I'm a complete beginner and I have no idea on where to start. I have done a bit of research and figured out that the best programming language for the core of this project would require python and use it with some machine learning??? So I have downloaded python literally yesterday and I have no idea what to do with it. What a developping envirnment is, how to use libraries or how to access them....

I know the basics of programming like the for and while loops, how to use them etcetera. I have also started but not finiched the python course on sololearn and codeacademy. So I know a bit of the syntax of the language etcetera.

 The problem is that I have now NO IDEA on how to start using python itself on my computer, how and what to learn to get started on my project, what other thing do I have to learn to implement it on a web browser add-on like I said earlier, how to make it into an app, how to make a good user interface...

So if you could please answer these 4 questions: 

* How do I get from where I am now to finishing this project ( like what steps do I have to follow) ? 
* What tools do I need to learn and understand?
* What sources would you recommend to learn from?
* Is this even possible?

I've always tried to avoid letting anyone know any information about my app's data structure. But now, I have to create some dynamic content using JSON objects.

So, out of the box, my database's data output can be used for my front end but this implies that my JSON obect's keys are my columns' actual name.

Now I want to generalize it to **any n**, and in that case a nested for loop is no longer a strategy. I am thinking of making it a recursive function, but don't know where to start, and don't know what to put in the searching machine.

To make a &lt;strong&gt;n = 4&lt;/strong&gt; case, I just need to add another outside for loop &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;for i4 = 1:k+1&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and change the equation inside to be &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;i(((((i4-1)*3+i3-1)*3+i2-1)*3+i1), : ) = [i1-1,i2-1,i3-1,i4-1];&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, which is as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;n = 4; k = 2;
i = zeros((k+1)^n,n);

for i4 = 1:k+1
    for i3 = 1:k+1
        for i2 = 1:k+1
            for i1 = 1:k+1
                i(((((i4-1)*3+i3-1)*3+i2-1)*3+i1),:) = [i1-1,i2-1,i3-1,i4-1]; 
            end
        end
    end
end
i
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to generalize it to &lt;strong&gt;any n&lt;/strong&gt;, and in that case a nested for loop is no longer a strategy. I am thinking of making it a recursive function, but don&amp;#39;t know where to start, and don&amp;#39;t know what to put in the searching machine.&lt;/p&gt;

The select preset function will make some changes in other components and cause a state change. How can I keep the option they picked, selected after the state change? It currently just resets back to the None option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an idea to just use the selected keyword in the properties of options, but only if the preset matched the one I saved to the state. So if it matched (the one they picked and the option) then set it to selected; but I feel my conditionals aren&amp;#39;t working correctly since &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot; is not defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Input
    onChange={this.selectPreset}

        return &amp;lt;option {...pID === this.state.presetId ?

814,,learnprogramming,"The way I see it, there are 3 major problems that make online self-learning difficult:

1. The biggest problem is to lack of instructions on what to learn. So you always end up not learning enough. And we only realize this when tackling a real project. If what you miss is small, you can use a Google search. If what you miss is big however, the holes in your knowledge keep lying there until a point where everything stop making sense. This lead to many think programming is something not for them, maybe even giving up programming. 
2. The second problem is about learning resources. Resources that are incomplete, outdated, incorrect or doesn't explain well enough =&gt; Frustration and waste of time. And then there is overabundance of resources for beginner-level topics =&gt; Analysis paralysis. Shortage of resources for specific advanced topics.
3. The third problem is about social learning. In real life, you can ask teacher or colleagues about your problems. On the Internet, everyone learn their own way so it takes extra efforts to understand other's problems. 

My solution is to have a proper system:

* It gives clear guidance on what to learn, handpick the best resources.
* It's built and maintained by a community. Feed-backs about what is wrong or missing are taken and quickly provide an update. Quality is increase over time. So we won't have to worry about finding the best resources anymore.

836,,learnprogramming,"Hello!

I dream of writing a program that will allow wireless file transfer from any android version (at least 4.0, if not older) and old computers running Windows 95. My aim is to develop an application that can allow direct file transferring from phone to machine, vise-versa. The problem these days is the lack of official driver support in many smartphones. Without an official driver, a computer cannot have a direct USB file transfer (this also affects some Linux distributions, I think). Alternatively, someone's phone usb port may not be stable enough to do a file transfer.

I want to develop something like SHAREit for Windows, then try making it compatible with other OSes.

My Basic Idea:  
\*\*Win32 Executable (64-bit version too)  
\*\*Wifi transfer method  
\*\*Bluetooth transfer method??? (if possible)  
\*\*Each computer and smartphone has a temporary code used to allow communication with each other.

For Development....  
\*\*Use Codeblocks (retain Windows 95 compatibility)  
\*\*Need to understand how to target old versions of android too

Background: 31 yr, longtime bartender who loves what he does but is looking for a career change. My best friend works at a tech startup in Seattle and recently got me interested in programming. Started doing research on line and think I would absolutely love the profession. I started looking into boot camps and after listening to your feedback, both positive and negative, I came to the conclusion that you a) should make sure you enjoy coding before committing and b) learn the basics before hand, lest you become overwhelmed and fail to learn the material at its fullest potential. To that end, I am half way through The Odin Project's Web Dev 101 and am really enjoying the work. Thus far I can build a website that looks like it should be running on Windows 95 lol. Kind of lame but also not to bad for only a couple weeks worth of studying. Unfortunately every time I learn one thing, I do some research and find a hundred other things that I need to know. I'm just hoping you guys can help give me a little direction in where to go next.  

1. What are some of the more accessible  programming roles to aim for? By no means am I looking for the ""easiest"" job, I am definitely aware that there will be an immense amount of knowledge base one has to acquire to become employable/proficient. I also would imagine that some positions require a far vaster/deeper skill set than others and that some jobs are just currently more in demand than others. Any feedback to this end would be most appreciated!
2. Kind of on the same note, I'm enjoying web dev but making websites is not exactly what I ultimately dream of doing. I absolutely love video games and would one day love to get into game development but realistically, that seems like more a passion project and not a particularly streamlined/efficient way to break into programming. From what I gather, JS is applicable to both front end design and some animation/game dev so in that sense I could be learning a skill set that would both get me employed as well as contribute to something more fulfilling. Any words of advice on that subject, or any skill set that I could focus on that might contribute to both job and hobby?
3. I can imagine there are probably hundreds of different roles/jobs in programming and unfortunately I am probably only aware of about six of them lol. Are then any interesting, fun or lucrative roles that don't necessarily see the same hype as more ubiquitous roles like ""front/back end developer""?
4. What are some of the things you really hate about programming or the tech industry in general?I would love a more balanced perspective on what I might have to deal with in the future. 
5. Big Tech hub vs. small but growing tech scene? So I used to live in Seattle and have recently moved to Boise. We are thinking about moving back but I'm not sure if that will help or hinder my ability to break into the tech industry. The way I figure, there must be considerably more tech Jobs in Seattle but also considerably more people applying for those jobs and who will be considerably better qualified. Would it be smarter to stick it out in a place with a small but growing tech scene with significantly less employment competition or two go immerse my self in the culture and fight it out with bigger fish? It would be nice to live in a place where I could meet up with other people learning programming and study together.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty skilled at the core front-end technologies in a way that many developers who primarily learned framework first might not be, so I&amp;#39;m also wondering if this 2-3+ years of experience is to buffer against this, e.g. giving these types of developers time to acquire general engineering skills.&lt;/p&gt;

Here we are in 2020 and I JUST picked the keyboard back up so to speak.  Been learning Python for the past couple of weeks and I'm feeling good.  Got a couple of projects put together and am actually in the process of going back and retooling them using Python-specific practices I've picked up on since their first iteration.  Trying to make them as clean as possible while I get my next project settled.

The thing is, I've never messed around with web app development.  Never touched JavaScript or anything like it -- though I've been told C# is very similar in design but not function -- and I don't know jack shit about HTML &amp; CSS.  As far as programming goes, all of my experience (save for minor HTML adjustments back in the MySpace days) has been outside of the browser.

I've got the feeling like it might be worth the effort to try to learn JavaScript / web development simultaneously while I develop more of a mastery over Python.  But I also feel like maybe that's not the best route I could take, and that maybe I'd save myself time and effort by just practicing Python for now and once I'm much more of a seasoned Python user I could probably combine that with my years of C# experience to just kind of intuit a majority of JavaScript.  But as I've never touched web dev, I don't have a clue if this is right or not.

Anybody have any advice for me?  In your opinion is it a worthwhile endeavor to take on the two different dev practices simultaneously?  What are your reasons for your sentiment?

I have a database at the moment (Postgresql) that stores details about a part for a product, the system is for stock control and may eventually be used for processing orders. I have a table of parts, this has the part id, name, the foreign key of where it came from, and the location of it in storage. (There are more tables, but shouldn't be relevant for this question)

I am now wanting to expand on it by adding details about the parts, the issue I have is I don't know how best to structure it. I am estimating 80-100 different types of specifications

I can see a few ways of doing it

1. Store all details in one field - don't want to do this as I think it will be a mess
2. Expand my table of parts so there is a column for each specification
3. Create an entity, attribute, value system (EAV) 

The possible problem that I can see with number 2 is that for most of the records 95% of the specifications will be blank, as only a few of the specs will apply to that record. 

At the moment there are approximately 1500 records(parts) and I estimate it to grow by about 1000 per year the the moment, so its quite a small database. I would just like to know how best to structure it and why.

886,,learnprogramming,"Thank you for any help you can give by pointing me in the right direction! This is something I've wondered about for years and finally have time in my life to jump in and explore it.

Specifically 

- What type of languages would I use?

- What type of programming theory would apply most?

- Interface can be web or stand-alone

- Any other resources I'd want to look at?

**SHORT VERSION**

Basically the title.

**LONG VERSION**

You'd have:

- individual entries in a database for specific models of CARS

- sub-entries for the PARTS that make up those cars

- sub-entries for the MATERIALS that make up the parts

- sub-entries for the manufacturing/mining PROCESSES required to get the materials 

- and so on. 

In fact, it's probably useful to not think of things as entries and sub-entries, but all the same kind of thing that can then be linked in different ways, creating dependencies.

I can imagine that the chain of dependencies could be unending, but probably flows mostly in one direction. So there wouldn't be infinite loops. But the chain could branch, such as MATERIALS connecting to PARTS and the CAR itself. 

You'd also want the flexibility to connect cars to even higher levels, like CLASSES of cars or brands, or date ranges. So stack dependencies. But also the ability to make base-level nodes dependent on even more base-level nodes once those are discovered. 

For example, the PROCESS of manufacturing might be a base level node, but then later you learn it's more complex so you need that PROCESS to depend on even more base level types of data.

Then at any level of the chain, you could run an analysis. All the dependencies are aware of each other. So if the manufacturing cost of a material or the mining cost changes, that would ripple up through the chain and affect everything else. The states of that data would literally change. (or maybe you want the flexibility to update data in different ways so you can compare various changes) And as you go up the chain you accumulate dependencies that can be collated to find useful information. 

For example...

1. If I improve mining cost, then it drops the parts by X% and then the total car cost comes down by Y%

2. If I use a different class of parts, the car is cheaper and stronger, but also heavier which increases gasoline consumption.

3. etc

So you could play with the dials or see where improvements in your manufacturing process might be most beneficial. A quick and easy way to evaluate complex changes.

Also, at any time someone could add new nodes of car information at any level, and that would connect to all other information where applicable. So let's say you create a new category called ""electric engines"". That would get inserted into the hierarchy and connected to all the cars as an option. Now you can use an electric engine instead, and you see all the materials and parts and processes linked to that and how it connects.

Further yet, you might want a way to evaluate a node from an as-yet-determined criteria. Let's say your system was built before being environmentally conscious. But now you want to see what type of car configuration is best for the environment. So you have a global ""filter"" that - at every level of the hierarchy - picks the most environmentally friendly option. So the most environment-safe mining practices, the best materials for the environment, the best manufacturing techniques, etc. At any level you could evaluate, but at the CAR level it would be useful because you can immediately see the difference in cost, strength, longevity, etc.

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d also want the flexibility to connect cars to even higher levels, like CLASSES of cars or brands, or date ranges. So stack dependencies. But also the ability to make base-level nodes dependent on even more base-level nodes once those are discovered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the PROCESS of manufacturing might be a base level node, but then later you learn it&amp;#39;s more complex so you need that PROCESS to depend on even more base level types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at any level of the chain, you could run an analysis. All the dependencies are aware of each other. So if the manufacturing cost of a material or the mining cost changes, that would ripple up through the chain and affect everything else. The states of that data would literally change. (or maybe you want the flexibility to update data in different ways so you can compare various changes) And as you go up the chain you accumulate dependencies that can be collated to find useful information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I improve mining cost, then it drops the parts by X% and then the total car cost comes down by Y%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I use a different class of parts, the car is cheaper and stronger, but also heavier which increases gasoline consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you could play with the dials or see where improvements in your manufacturing process might be most beneficial. A quick and easy way to evaluate complex changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, at any time someone could add new nodes of car information at any level, and that would connect to all other information where applicable. So let&amp;#39;s say you create a new category called &amp;quot;electric engines&amp;quot;. That would get inserted into the hierarchy and connected to all the cars as an option. Now you can use an electric engine instead, and you see all the materials and parts and processes linked to that and how it connects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further yet, you might want a way to evaluate a node from an as-yet-determined criteria. Let&amp;#39;s say your system was built before being environmentally conscious. But now you want to see what type of car configuration is best for the environment. So you have a global &amp;quot;filter&amp;quot; that - at every level of the hierarchy - picks the most environmentally friendly option. So the most environment-safe mining practices, the best materials for the environment, the best manufacturing techniques, etc. At any level you could evaluate, but at the CAR level it would be useful because you can immediately see the difference in cost, strength, longevity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you for any information. I don&amp;#39;t even know where to start looking.&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm doing some challenges at exercism and one challenge is to return a string depending on the factors of a given number. I solved this using if statements but wanted to change it so that it could be expandable and found this solution from another user.   


I don't understand it entirely though and wanted some help from the community to see how this code works. I did some testing and saw that the ""\[value for key, value in factors if number % key == 0\]"" line returns a list and then you just join them using """".join(). But for example: why is there a comma there? Shouldn't python understand this as elements at either side of the comma?

Let's say I choose the number 21. What is happening in between the brackets? How does this line seem to iterate every tuple, get the value and key, compare the key to my chosen number and then put a value in the list depending on the result of the comparison in such a compact way?

So i thought maybe we can talk about the mind set behind it, like just the thought processes. 

The first thing i thought was ok i have this list and it needs to equal a number with addition. So the first thing i should do is remove everything from the list that is higher than the number i need equal. I then made a second list of these lower numbers because i had to put them somewhere. 

Then I thought, heck if my new list only has 2 numbers and they equal the target its solved. Easy enough. Bam return.

But now the trouble, what if it has 3 or 4 or 5 numbers. I cant really wrap my head around this part.  My noob attempt can solve for the specific first test case they give but of course its not correct giving any variation. I could probably make a loop that adds index 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4 etc. But that work work if the solution is index 1 and 4. How does one loop over all variations of all list items? That sounds impossibly complex to me.

I looked at the discussion board and i don't even understand what those guys did. I am also confused as to why I seem to be the only one with the idea to remove numbers higher than the target. It seems like that would limit the calculations and loops but it doesn't seem to save any time and peoples answers don't even think about that.

The only reason I&amp;#39;m considering it is because I need the structure and discipline that come from taking a formal class. I&amp;#39;ve tried taking a Udemy one on my own but never had the discipline to pay attention and finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the ReactJS course worth the $4k?&lt;/p&gt;

Since from a long time I wanted to get into depth in Java but was
always stuck with basics, like reading OOPs basics and practising,
writing small programs, solve codeabbey problems. So I decided this
year to learn Spring framework and build something useful in the end.
But with a 2 year old kid and 9-6 job, it's hard to follow along. Plus
when I was in a flow, solving codeabbey problems was fun till I hit a
roadblock on some out of my league problems related to data
structures, not getting much time to gather my attention and focus on
them. Is it just me or everyone deals with this shitty frustration. My
day job doesn't really involve much programming on day-to-day basis. I
know I can do more, but I am just all over the place like white on
rice, not able to focus on one single thing at a time. Also I believe
in code kata, practice programming everday but what I get is time in
travelling.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rather new to programming, perhaps a lot. I've always seen programming as this impossible thing where you either gotta be beyond IQ 150 or have the possibility to go to Uni and study computer science, now that I found so many good places to learn a programming language I'm having a blast while still pulling my hair out due to frustration...

Ever since I've always searched for programming guides/courses/tutorials and which one you should learn, people always recommend python, I was told too that I should learn python too, yet... I could not understand python to slightest, the language only made me give up even more yet apparently python is a language very friendly with beginners. Simple functions and the way it is written made me feel like maybe programming isn't for me, and so for a while, I stopped trying, I felt intimidated by something people call ""beginner-friendly"" and rather than just demotivated me it made feel like I'm probably just too stupid to learn anything about programming.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as some time passed by, I've decided to give learning a programming language a second chance, this time my friend recommended me learning Java and I have to say, Java is like my first love. I understood the language, syntax and how it works without a problem, the language made me feel and think like a program! Sure there are times where I have no clue what I'm doing, it frustrates me, it's a language I probably can't chase my dream which is game development because of how complex and scary it sounds to create everything out of thin air for a beginner like me without tools that C# has e.g. Unity...

I wish I knew or was told how easy Java is to learn for a beginner rather than Python, because I think I wouldn't waste my time trying to learn something I could of never understand, obviously each person learns differently, each person finds each language easier to understand as well... But my question ever since I learned about Java is... Why is Python always the one recommended for complete programming beginners? I'm sure there are many other people like me who attempted learning to program and gave up.

Is it because of how over-saturated/popular the language is?

we bring our own to the  auditorium and install monitoring software (made by the programming professors) wich to my knowlege captures screenshots at regular intervals.

&amp;#x200B;

so i was thinking of a theory wich is basically a exam aimbot that works along the lines of this:

assuming that most of the questions are multiple choice

&amp;#x200B;

\-the program captures/downloads the html file

\-it looks for an &lt;ul&gt; element

\-it scans every &lt;li&gt; element for having a value of 1(giving me 1 point for the correct answer the rest should be 0)

\-it controls your mouse to select the &lt;li&gt; element with the 1 value (or gives the answer in an obscure manner)

\-it all works in the background and it doesnt show up in the taskbar.

second i dont know if the monitoring software checks background tasks so pretty risky.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we bring our own to the  auditorium and install monitoring software (made by the programming professors) wich to my knowlege captures screenshots at regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i was thinking of a theory wich is basically a exam aimbot that works along the lines of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;assuming that most of the questions are multiple choice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-the program captures/downloads the html file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-it looks for an &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; element&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-it scans every &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; element for having a value of 1(giving me 1 point for the correct answer the rest should be 0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-it controls your mouse to select the &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; element with the 1 value (or gives the answer in an obscure manner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-it all works in the background and it doesnt show up in the taskbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first of all this is straight up cheating/fraud but is this possible?&lt;/p&gt;

The C course requires that I use Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu) and suggest that I use Visual Studio Code. However the instructions for installing VSC were unclear and I want to use Clion since it shares roughly the same UI as Pycharm. I got the typical ""Hello world""-program working, but now I'm struggling with getting math.h to work.

I understand that I have to add a -lm (link math?) to somewhere but after googling and reinstalling several times I can't figure it out. Is it a text file that I have to edit?

So I got a lot of good advice from people on this sub on the technical side of learning Java as well as advice on how to do well in the interview process. I actually contacted the recruiter and asked if it were possible to have an extension on the interview to sharpen my Java skills and she said it was fine, so I had a bit less than a week in the end to prepare.

I'm happy to say I got the job! :)

In the end the interview was actually really chill. It was my first ever proper ""whiteboard"" interview and I expected some animosity from the intervewer however that couldn't be further from the truth. She actually guided me through the tasks and it felt like we were working together on the problems as opposed to it being a clinical assessment of my skills.

If I can give any advice to other new grads looking to land their first gig it is to **remember the human aspect of the process**. I think a lot of people look at a technical interview similar to a school exam where if you just memorise certain formulas you are guaranteed to pass. The reality is that the interviewer is looking for so much more than your ability to regurgitate DFS and Quicksort - they want to see who you are as a person. How you respond to criticism, how you attack a problem, your listening skills, your communication skills are all things that you're going to be judged on. In the few hours you'll have in the company of the interviewer you need to be aware of how you're projecting these characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy to say I got the job! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the interview was actually really chill. It was my first ever proper &amp;quot;whiteboard&amp;quot; interview and I expected some animosity from the intervewer however that couldn&amp;#39;t be further from the truth. She actually guided me through the tasks and it felt like we were working together on the problems as opposed to it being a clinical assessment of my skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can give any advice to other new grads looking to land their first gig it is to &lt;strong&gt;remember the human aspect of the process&lt;/strong&gt;. I think a lot of people look at a technical interview similar to a school exam where if you just memorise certain formulas you are guaranteed to pass. The reality is that the interviewer is looking for so much more than your ability to regurgitate DFS and Quicksort - they want to see who you are as a person. How you respond to criticism, how you attack a problem, your listening skills, your communication skills are all things that you&amp;#39;re going to be judged on. In the few hours you&amp;#39;ll have in the company of the interviewer you need to be aware of how you&amp;#39;re projecting these characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

952,,learnprogramming,"Hi Learn Programming!

I'm a high school STEM teacher.  I'm helping my department modernize our rather small set of course offerings.

Last year all we had was a keyboarding class, a one-term introduction to visual basic course and a graphic design course.  This year we've added Computer Science Principles that is largely project based that eventually leads to independent Python programming projects, which is a good start, but we'd really like to add several other classes.

Here is a list of classes we're considering offering.

\-**Robotics** (My administration seems very excited about offering a course based on the First Robotics Competition.  Java or C++ programming can be used, but this will only be a portion of the course.)

\-**Web design/programming**

\-**App development** (Probably starting MIT app inventor and then switching to Java and possibly Swift.  This could also replace about 4/5 of the AP Principles class if that appealed to students.  I know there is a Principles curriculum entirely based around MIT App Inventor.  )

**-Cybersecurity** (Know of any good curriculum for this?)

\-**Animation** (Many of our students and a couple of our teachers are familiar with Inventor, so I was thinking teaching Maya might be possible since I've heard that's similar.  More likely the electronic art teacher would handle this though.  Any suggestions for curriculum or software for a course like this?)

\-**Video Game Development** (a.) Either Unity/C# based with a strong emphasis on design, or b.)creating 2d games using Java, Javascript, or Python with an emphasis on using game creation to teach programming skills.  I've heard of one teacher using option b. to teach pre-ap and ap CS Principles)

\-**Networking** (Possibly Cisco)

\-**Language-specific programming such as with Java.**  (Perhaps AP CSA.  Is this a quality course that isn't too tedious?  Might be a good course to act as 'advanced app programming since it uses Java?')

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions are welcome!  What classes would be most worthwhile... since we probably can't offer them all.

The electronic art teacher will probably offer one more art class, like animation.  I'm one of two programming teachers... and I think I may be the only one interested in moving in a programming direction since we've hired people that can take care of most of my courses.  At most I think we can offer 4 more courses, but that is uncertain this point.

The limited number of courses we might be able to offer is partly why I suggest using AP courses as a phone app or game creation course since we are already offering AP Principles.  I think those two courses, in particular, could be useful for recruitment...

Suggestions for software, materials, or curriculum for said courses is also very welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Some other classes that we would consider adding.  I expect that some of these could be done by people outside the department, such as the Film Production and Music Production class  May depend on teacher expertise in the Theatre and Music department.

TL;DR: How one communicate two applications in different computers? Is it a terrible idea do this on a shared text file over internal network?

For context:

I'm in an internship at a small Asset Management company. My boss has developed an algorithm for his quantitative trading strategy that runs on his computer. I need to develop an application that receive his trades decisions end execute them on another computer that has the bloomberg terminal.

Here comes the problem:  
I'm having trouble to decide on how to communicate these two applications. My boss suggested that we use a shared file over the internal network that would be written to by his application and read by mine trading application.

But I keep thinking: Is this a reasonable way of implementing this? Wouldn't be terribly slow? It seems to me like a jerry-rig (i guess that's the english term that I'm looking for).

I first thought of two other solutions that I'm not familiar and would have to learn to use them: sockets (which seems simpler, but too much low level... it seems like it would be a lot of trouble). Build an API using flask on python (which I fear it may be an overkill, but it seems like could be done in an organized way and without too much effort once i learned the basics of it).

So, how would be the right approach to this problem?
