47,,datascience,"Hi r/datascience

I'm planning to write a tutorial mini-series covering production grade data engineering. This will include building and maintain an end-to-end data ecosystem. **I would love for this to solve a real-world data use case and the tutorial progressively adds more complexity in solving that use case.**   
Since I work in infrastructure, it would be *naive* for me to assume that I know of a use case that would be helpful for the community so i'm hoping this community can help me understand a real-world data problem that a good portion of the community would like me to solve in these tutorials.

Ideally this would be something that covers data ingestion, processing, modeling and using that processed data for decision making.

An example would be **Calculating the  Intrinsic Value/Price for Stocks**.   
I would cover ingesting all fundamental and price data, modeling and storing it in a usable format, processing it to calculate the intrinsic value and then using it to help with your current stock portfolio allocation. This could eventually also get into streaming the input data and making automated decisions on it.   


Would love to hear your thoughts on real-world data use cases which I can solve through this tutorial mini-series.

In my work with major F500 companies I saw big forecasting software being used, but some close friends who are small business owners expressed frustration that they didn't have the IT infrastructure or budget to implement that stuff (1M/yr, SAP integration, IT management, DS needed to work them, and the cheap excel plugin stuff doesn't cut it).

It's fully operational (and free for beta users) and I'm currently about half-way done building the API, which i will build python and R packages to support.

I built the site with Django, DB with Postgres, then a combo of Nginx/gunicorn/supervisor hosted by digital ocean, stripe for payment processing. API is the Django REST framework.

I'm working with someone who would like me to integrate our group's scientific data with another group's scientific data.

The problem is that unfortunately our group and theirs have use entirely different technologies to generate the measurements.  Ours used a method of digital counting in integer values (subsequently normalized).  Theirs used an old-school analog method of quantifying fluorescence intensity (and normalized in their way).  

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like the kind of thing that would be common among data scientists (and people in my own field with more experience doing this kind of thing).  Is there a simple way to drop both datasets into a single matrix and then cluster their samples with ours?  I imagine I should probably do some kind of normalization to transform them all to normal distributions centered at 1, or something like that (though I have no idea if the data is normally distributed), and then perform some kind of cleaning to remove batch effects, and then I'd be good to go?

71,,datascience,"Hey all. I'm a data scientist finding myself rewriting my résumé for the first time since undergrad (2015). I had a couple questions for best practices in data science résumé writing. For background, I'm currently pursuing a part-time Master of Engineering in Data Analytics from a top US public university. Questions:

- Is it relevant to put GPA or number of credits completed for my ongoing master's degree? I have maintained a 4.0 and am on the home stretch so I think it would only make it stronger, but not sure if grad GPA is something that is typically shared on résumés
- Should I include my internship of my current company? Nothing really relevant in terms of data science substance, but I guess it would show that I have technically been with the company since 2014 (showing loyalty?)
- I've had a couple job titles (""Systems Engineer"", ""Senior Data Scientist"") since starting full time, but my roles and accomplishments evolved continuously- the promotion was more retrospectively acknowledging an increase in responsibilities. Is it okay to describe both positions with a shared description or do I need to segregate them and specifically describe my roles for each one?

I know what queries I want to run on the data when I get it, and I have a good idea of what sort of analysis I am going to do in R once I have the data I need from the MusicBrainz database, but I am getting tripped up with how to access the data once I download it from their site. I am pretty strong analytically and usually understand the theory behind data analysis, but I worked in manufacturing for 13 years (where computers are barely even used) before MBA and I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of experience with using computer programs that aren&amp;#39;t basic point and click GUI interface. I&amp;#39;m using a Mac if that changes anything. This is the site I downloaded from:
&lt;a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Download""&gt;https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... can someone please help me on what steps I need to take, what programs I need to download, etc. so that I can access this database? If there is a site you can direct me to as well, I&amp;#39;ll be happy to read and figure it out on my own, but at this point I&amp;#39;ve probably wasted 10 hours trying to do that and I have nothing to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been a data scientist at a SF-based tech unicorn for the past 4 years. 

I am doing pretty well! I am on track to become a data science manager here in the next couple years. I love my job, colleagues, the work life balance it provides me, and I’m paid quite well. I am privileged. Some might say I am living the data science dream... ;-)

However, as time goes by, I am having trouble finding **purpose** in what the job I do. Even if my company’s mission is quite positive (I believe that, in general, we are doing good for the world), at the end of the day my job is to create mechanisms to maximize sales. 

On top of it, as the company grows in size, I am having trouble seeing the **direct** **impact of my work** on the end user, and on the world. 

I am passionate about many topics related to social good, such as education, social justice, mental health... and have been thinking about exploring new careers in such fields. But I worked so hard to get where I am today, and I think I got really good at data science, it would be a shame for me to completely switch gears towards a different career where I cannot leverage these skills. 

So here is my 1 million dollar question: **how do I combine my love for data science with my desire to do good for the world?** 

Here are a few things I explored and have proven unsuccessful: 

* **start a social good initiative from inside my company (eg some work about climate change)**: this behavior is not encouraged in my current job, and would be to the detriment of my immediate career. 
* **search for jobs in data science in organizations with a social good component**: I tried LinkedIn, angel list, even Reddit, but nothing pops up. Data science currently overindexes on tech. 
* **volunteer for a cause in my free time**: there are a lot of options, but none where I can leverage my DS skills

I spent most of my uni life trying to figure out what I wanted to do (first I thought mechanical, then switched to CS, thought I would focus on app development, then switched to machine learning). By the time I decided I want to get into data science, I was already in my final year. I wasn't very enthusiastic about my courses until then, and looking back on it now, I feel like I wasted most of my time (instead of thoroughly focusing on important concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and statistics).

During my final year, I took some courses on NLP, machine learning, and computer vision. I also was doing some part-time work with SQL and web scraping for a startup. When I had free time, I took some Coursera and Udemy courses on topics like Python, SQL, Spark, R, etc. I even worked on a group final year project, which was recognised as one of the best projects that year. Once I graduated, I started working full-time at the startup as an ""associate data scientist"", and over the past two years I've been working with data pipelining, some machine learning, and databases. Even now I feel guilty from time to time about the time I wasted in university, especially when core programming topics are discussed at work.

Now, I have learnt my lesson, and have also decided that I want to specialise in data science. I really want to work with music data, particularly for music recommendation. I have accepted the mistakes I made in university, learned from them, and am willing to work hard if I get a second chance at school. But considering my low GPA, I'm very skeptical about whether I even have options at this point.

Do you think there's any hope for someone like me to become successful in data science? If so, do you have any suggestions or advice on how I can go about this given my situation? I am really willing to do anything I can to get into a master's programme so that I can give myself a second chance.

155,,datascience,"I'm currently a Manager of ""Analytics"" for a traditional media company. I'm also getting my MS in Analytics part time through an online program.

So first about my job and my career. I really have enjoyed working in product analytics. In my last job I was working for a mobile app and got to work closely with iOS/Android devs, data engineers, and data scientists. I learned an immense amount about tech and it was amazing. I was exposed to things like AWS S3, Athena query engine, ELK Stack, etc. And because I was constantly around engineers, I just learned a lot of random things about tech, like what are parquet files, JSON file format, accessing API endpoints, encryption hash methods, etc. I loved all of it.

After 2 years, I decided to leave the job because the pay wasn't the best. I managed to get a Manager role making 40% more in base salary. Unfortunately I let my pursuit of money blindside me. I ended up in a company that is not technical at all. I don't work with any engineers or technical people. The majority of my coworkers work in things like production, publicity, finance, etc. I feel extremely out of place. In addition, there is not a lot of technical work for me to do. Instead of analyzing, querying, building scripts, etc., I find myself building decks on high level business problems on non-Analytics projects, like building a long range strategic plan, customer loyalty program or building a Brand budget.

It's obvious to me that I should have quit this job a long time ago. I've been here about 1 year now and mentally I made the decision to quit 3 months in. However, things changed when I got accepted to my MS program. The MS program has been fairly time intensive. Grad school is no joke. One privilege of this job has been the ability to spend quite a bit of my work time doing school work. My current job may not be technical or analytical, but it affords me a lot of time to actually just do school work. This is an incredible perk that I don't think I would get anywhere else. But on the other hand, I'm not developing or growing my career. At the end of the day, I chose to get my MS to enhance my career. I thought a combination of grad school + job would help, but right now my job feels like an anchor dragging my development down.

What should I do? I want to continue growing in Analytics and Data Science. I will admit I don't think I'm technical enough to become a Data Scientist (hence why I'm doing the MS program), but I'd love to go back to a job like my last job where I'm working in a technical environment. If I could have it my way, I would be a Manager of Product Analytics or something.

Do you think I should just suck it up and tolerate my job until I finish grad school and use the free time to my advantage? Or do you think that is detrimental to career growth as experience triumphs academics and that I should look for another job ASAP?

My only concerns about starting another job is that there's a lot of risk and work involved. Starting a new job means you have to build up your credibility again. The first 6 months will be a lot of hard work to establish myself and rep and it can be difficult to manage on top of school. The other risk is I could run into a boss that is not supportive of me. I'm fortunate in my current role because my boss did his MBA part time while working, so he definitely allows me to operate at a less than 100% capacity. I may not necessarily get the same treatment if I go elsewhere.

Looking for some advice - I’ve been set a project to define churn in an e-commerce business. I’ve only ever calculated churn in scenarios where users have a fixed subscription end date so this is a new one for me.

The data points I have, are individual transaction timestamps, transaction amounts, timestamps when the customer interacted with the site and the timestamp when the customer first set up an account.

The questions I’ve been asked are:
1. Define an appropriate churn metric for such a business
2. Explain how the business can measure said churn metric with minimal delay and skewness in the data.

I’ve got a few ideas for the first part namely:
1. Define an appropriate window in time (7,14,30 days) and look at how many users don’t return within said window from their last transaction.
2. Look at rolling average spend and see if a users falls by a defined parameter i.e. halves over 30days

What I’m struggling with is how to define appropriate cohorts for the second part - I’m not sure how’d you go about defining windows to ensure you don’t skew the data? I assume there would always be some skew from macro trends like seasonality.

So looking at big companies who have a dozen of datascientists working for them (too low compared to what kind of IT specialists they have in total) and a lot of big companies who even doesn't see the benefit of DStists,  it looks like there is not much work for the overhyped datascience community.

Of course the whole situation could also backfire as if you see this as an opportunity (instead of a problem), it could also mean that companies are sleeping. So with a new startup you could also have a leverage with datascience and create amazing products what could put them out of business.

At the risk of getting roasted, I'd like to ask a question and figured this was the best place to do it.  I don't presume myself to be a data scientist, I know there are people who have worked very hard to get degrees on the subject.

I'm self-taught in SQL, but I only write queries and use BI tools. With that being said I'm fairly confident I could stay up all night binging Harry Potter, and easily pass a test consisting of joins, subqueries, where/having/case statements, json objects etc.

I'm applying for a new job and sometimes seeing experienced with ETL and data pipelines as desired or preferred. I skipped the chapter on creating tables since I didn't have permission for that in my last role, but (1) the syntax seemed fairly simple? (2) technically anyone could use a tool called cyberduck to finagle a table into existence, which I did as needed.

I guess I am hoping to find out (1) if it is worth mentioning that I know how you would go about creating a table in an interview (i.e. I know the syntax), (2) if it might be nonconsequential since I am otherwise SQL literate and therefore could easily learn this skill on the job, (3) if it is a distinct and significant skillset to the point of omg-go-take-a-udemy **right now** sort of thing.

176,,datascience,"Hi all, I’ve been lurking for a while but have appreciated a lot of the detailed advice that many of the more senior people here have provided. With 3 years of experience in data science, I’m kind of at a career crossroads now and I would like some advice. Unfortunately this is probably going to be a kinda long post and I hope you guys will bear with me, I really appreciate anyone who is willing to take time to read and reply.

**My background** 

I obtained my PhD in machine learning from a top 20 US university a few years back. Had 2 top-tier (e.g. NeurIPS/ICML) first author publications working broadly in information retrieval field, with another 2 smaller conference publications. Post-PhD I was not super interested in going down the research path, realized I like exploring new algorithms and building pipelines and making things work, but not so much doing all the experiments and writing them up for publication. 

Currently I am working for a company  where we do internal R&amp;D and also some external R&amp;D engagements with clients or other collaborators. My work experience comprises 3 main tasks: 

1. Engaging potential clients with business development team to assess their business problems and data readiness, and propose appropriate analytics pipelines to support their needs 

2. Leading applied ML projects that clients have engaged us for 

3. performing small data science projects, either on sample data from potential collaborators to convince them of our value, or just for exploring new tools/methods.

I am planning to leave soon because 

1. I am unable to generate as much impact (in terms of business outcomes, process improvements etc) both internally and with external clients/collaborators as I would like here.

2. I have reached the limit of my growth in terms of software engineering skills as most people here are more interested in the science than productionization. Probably better than most statisticians/data scientists/PhD students (reusable ML pipelines, proper documentation/version control, CI, Docker for reproducibility, etc) but probably worse than most junior SWEs due to lack of experience working collaboratively on large software projects.

My main achievements are 

1. Completing an data science project collaboration with a large MNC resulting in them filing several patents (not ML related and without my name on them, due to contractual IP issues), and publications in development
2. Completing an applied predictive ML project which resulted in an invention disclosure and demonstrated improvements in metrics during a small-scale live deployed test (though for various reasons, was as far as the client took the project)
3. Leading an internal initiative to develop reusable tools for some future projects and getting funding, built a simple first iteration and demonstrated there are substantial development time savings along with other benefits
4. Having some sense of the challenges large companies in several domains face in using data science through many discussions with potential clients/collaborators 

**Questions**

I'm thinking of either moving to an ML engineering role at a top tier tech company (eg FAANG, Airbnb, LinkedIn) or moving to another (senior) data scientist position where I can create more impact. To this end I have the following questions:

1. I feel like the outcomes from my work have not demonstrated enough added value due to the lack of impact on bottom line, yet I have also not acquired sufficient software engineering skills to move directly into an ML engineering role at a tech company. Could anyone comment on how accurate my perception is? 
    
2. Given my profile, would I be qualified for a senior data scientist role or would it be a stretch? How much would people value my academic qualifications/publications in an applied role in industry?

3. Broadly speaking how should I structure my resume? I currently have it such that my work experience section is further divided into the major projects I did, with a section on my business development experience. 

4.    I don’t know what to do with all the scattered little hacky projects/explorations/demos that I have had to do that don’t have any tangible output, but have taken up quite a bit of my time over the years and also exposed me to certain tools/frameworks or algorithms that I was previously unfamiliar with. Should I list them in an ‘other projects’ section or something?

5.   I only have a small paragraph about my PhD research and my publication list (about 4-5). Should I expand more about what I did during my PhD or do most companies not care?

I’m hoping someone can help me wrap my head around this. I’m interested in the more experimental/CI side of DS so I’ve been reading up on AB testing and learning about the problems that can go with it if carried out improperly. I don’t understand peeking. 


I know that an AB test is an RCT and that under the frequentist fixed horizon approach you choose an n and then wait until that is reached to evaluate the results. So, I understand that trying to stop before hand would be wrong but only in the sense that it “goes against the rules”. I don’t understand the mechanics/math of why it’s wrong and how peeling so dramatically inflates the false positive rate. I’ve read the Evan Miller article and about 20 other blogs/papers on it in search of finding an example I can understand bc usually once I read things enough times I can get it. But not with this one and it’s driving me crazy.


I think part of the issue is that I was a social science major and learned about RCT done the traditional way so I don’t even understand what people are doing. People in my company are always talking about ‘continuing a test bc it’s not significant yet’ or ‘stopping a test bc it looks bad’ but that makes no sense to me! How can you decide sample size as you go along? Isn’t waiting for significance just ensuring mistakes because you’re essentially waiting to be shown a difference even if there is none? But, at the same time if you reach at large enough n and decide to stop ahead of time why does that so badly mess everything up?


At this point, I’m so confused I no longer even know what I’m confused about so im sorry if this makes no sense.

187,,datascience,"Hi everyone,

I understand that there are a multitude of posts regarding how to break into Data Science (DS) without a CS degree or PhD; however, I haven't seen one discussing what non-CS, non-PhD Data Scientist do once they're one in terms of career prospects. I hope this post will allow those type of people to share their experiences.

I’m a new age Product/Analytics Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but limited data engineering and no production-level ML). Having worked for several months, I have become keenly aware of several things about myself:

1. I lack the CS background required to become a Data Engineer (setting up data lakes from scratch; ETL automation; deploying a ML model to production);
2. I lack the PhD background and also do not enjoy the high-level mathematics that will be required to become a ML Engineer (building and optimising cutting-edge algorithms);
3. I lack the economics/finance background to become an DS Economist (focusing on econometrics).

In short, due to my background, I feel like I’m a half-baked DS who can only remain as a Product/Analyst DS, unless I put a ludicrous amount of time and effort to overcome my (MSc in structural engineering) background and specialise. Similarly, it’ll be very difficult for me to become a non-specialised “full-stack” DS which is highly sought in small-midscale startups. I’ve also been told that DS Managers who lack technical/specialised expertise are unable to climb far in the management career ladder (say Head of Data), which means just remaining in my current position will likely be a bad move in the long term.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a new age Product/Analytics Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but limited data engineering and no production-level ML). Having worked for several months, I have become keenly aware of several things about myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lack the CS background required to become a Data Engineer (setting up data lakes from scratch; ETL automation; deploying a ML model to production);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lack the PhD background and also do not enjoy the high-level mathematics that will be required to become a ML Engineer (building and optimising cutting-edge algorithms);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lack the economics/finance background to become an DS Economist (focusing on econometrics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, due to my background, I feel like I’m a half-baked DS who can only remain as a Product/Analyst DS, unless I put a ludicrous amount of time and effort to overcome my (MSc in structural engineering) background and specialise. Similarly, it’ll be very difficult for me to become a non-specialised “full-stack” DS which is highly sought in small-midscale startups. I’ve also been told that DS Managers who lack technical/specialised expertise are unable to climb far in the management career ladder (say Head of Data), which means just remaining in my current position will likely be a bad move in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that were in a similar situation, what did you end up doing and how did it work out? Did you grit your teeth and specialise, or did you end up switching careers? Please share your experiences!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for some opinions regarding data visualization. I have an analyst role and my manager (not analyst or DS) wants to shift all our reports to some sort of dashboard. I generate most of the data using Python and mainly plot with Plotly. However, I am new to the role (it's a new role) so there's quite a bit of freedom.

I was wondering what you guys would recommend or what are your own experiences. Would you use Power BI or something like Dash in Python to generate dashboards/reports? I'm interested to read your opinions. Would it be more valuable for my career (DS/Analytics) to know how to make my own dashboards or to learn how to use Power BI? Is one more flexible than the other?

I am posting to spread news of a new type of data science degree at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the [Master of Science in Civic Analytics (MSCA)](http://go.uic.edu/msca). The program is approved by the Illinois Board of Higher Education and is accepting applications for Fall 2020. The  degree is the first of its kind; merging advanced study in civic technology and data analytics into one curriculum.

The MSCA provides  preparation in principles of data science, including coding, statistics, data management, geospatial methods, and AI &amp; machine learning, while being anchored  within public service, its problems, and ethics. The program  incorporates active involvement in the Chicago civic technology community through service learning, civic innovation and [hacktivism](https://chihacknight.org/).

The curriculum prepares students to assume positions as data/information officers, geospatial analysts, policy analysts, and program evaluators  in government agencies (city, state, federal) and nonprofits. Students may also find employment as specialists within government services contractors and consulting firms. Courses are taught by our highly-ranked college faculty, as well as leading practitioners in Chicago's civic technology community.

211,,datascience,"I'm researching practical steps that data science teams can take to ensure model fairness. If you practice data science in a regulated environment or where your work has the potential to significantly impact the wellbeing of people, I'd love to hear how you go about identifying bias in your data and models, and ensure model fairness. 

There's been plenty recent research into model fairness and bias, but not yet much discussion around processes and practices that data science teams can adopt to systematically address these areas. (The [FairDM model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00176v2) is an interesting start, though.)

Some thoughts on how one might go about building fairness into standard practices:

# Exploratory data analysis includes evaluation for systemic biases
- Analysis of data includes removal or marking of features that are either directly related to protected sub-groups / classes (or similar) or are highly correlated with same.
- Data augmentation with public or proprietary datasets in order to achieve the above (e.g. augment zip codes with race distributions from census data in order to identify other features correlated with race).
- Analyze the risk that the training data itself is biased and likely to perpetuate systemic biases.

# Model training evaluation
- Evaluate metrics by subgroup (for e.g. false positive rate by gender)
- Understand feature importance, model interpretation using SHAP/ LIME etc. Potentially slicing by subgroups.

# Post-hoc analysis of production inference results
- Alongside regular model monitoring, evaluate metrics by subgroup/class.

But some background first. You can keep that paragraph if you want. It's just there to help you get an idea of what I've been dealing with

I graduated almost 2 years ago with a BS in math and after failing to get into grad school, I have been working for the past 2 years as a teacher for people suffering from dyslexia.

However, as I see new people coming into my workplace get promoted because they're certified or at least academically trained in education while I'm just getting the same work with the same pay, I think my time is up.

I think that going to school for a master's program is inevitable at this point and since nothing is free, I guess I gotta take on the debt. I have a few school programs in mind. I didn't take the GRE yet nor do I have the cash ready for it, but I'm planning on taking it then apply to a few schools.

More specifically, we are trying to predict the probability that a click will result in a purchase order. The problem is that then dataset that we have access to is pre-aggregated by sum of orders and sum of clicks. 

I’ve done a decent amount of research, and unfortunately, I have not come across many results. Based on my research, it looks like I have the following options but I want to ensure that I am going down the right route:

(1) Use regression techniques like linear regression (or beta regression), decision tree, random forest, etc. but I know this is not the ideal solutions for predicting probability when the dataset is not binary.

(2) Use the typical models for probability by converting the dataset to event level like logistic regression, naive bayes, etc. I could create a row for every click and a row for every order. Label clicks as 0 and orders as 1 in my dependent variable. This is feasible but I am concerned about whether there are any implications to use a binary event level dataset to predict an aggregated dataset in production.

I do a lot of work in the field of Evolutionary Computation, and that means I'm constantly running computationally expensive code and repeated experiments. One thing I'm really tired of is the manual and tedious effort that goes into getting the code for my experiments up and running on some hardware, be it a cluster or AWS.

Currently, to run large code jobs and batches, you have a few options. You can use a cluster with some sort of job scheduler like Slurm, you can use a platform like AWS and Lambda, Fargate, etc. or you can manage things manually. Then you have to track and visualise all the jobs you've run for a project (Google sheets for example).

I'm building a web based platform with an intuitive UI that abstracts and automates a lot of the work needed to set up job scheduling, so that software jobs can easily be run on the cloud either serverlessly or through linked hardware. There'll also be a nice component for visualising your projects and how the jobs in them are progressing, and viewing and downloading results.

I've already built a minimum version of this for running a set of repeated experiments in my research, using AWS instances. It helped a lot with running and managing large amounts of software jobs and I couldn't help but feel like others may find something like this useful.

I have an existing model used on motorcycles that would work awesome with it. Great opportunity to tweak it and create a Streamlit app. 

But... Then, I read the TOS of the site the data was scraped from. It strictly forbids web scraping for any use. [The Car Connection TOS](https://www.internetbrands.com/ibterms/)

But... The 9th District court ruled that [web scraping is legal](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/web-scraping-doesnt-violate-anti-hacking-law-appeals-court-rules/)

254,,datascience,"I am a newly hired data scientist a financial services firm. I have a BS in Statistics &amp; Data Science.

One dataset with 1,000,000 rows which I have been given is mixed with the following...

Categorical features: ClientName, ServiceProvidedID, TaxReturnID, Entity, and AccountNumber, and TaxReturnGroup

Continuous features: BookBalance (in dollars)

Text features: TaxReturnSubGroup

The firm had previously used third party sources to develop a classification model where TaxReturnGroup was the target and the predictors were everything described above except TaxReturnSubGroup. This model was made so the tax workers can automate the choosing of the TaxReturnGroup for their clients based on the model predictors. They want to do the same thing for the TaxReturnSubGroup, however, this is a text field (i.e. the tax guys have been typing in this field as they see fit as there is not standard group of labels to choose from). So, they want me to find the optimal standard labels for this field to make it categorical and then iterate on their model making TaxReturnGroup an additional predictor and TaxReturnSubGroup the target classifier. 

My question...

How can I find the optimal standard labels for TaxReturnSubGroup? In other words, how can I convert a text field to a categorical field in an optimized way such that the number of categories is not too large and also the categories are granular/descriptive enough?

The initial idea they have passes on to me is to cluster the data in an optimized way (i.e. find the optimum number of clusters) and then see what kind of TaxReturnSubGroups values exist in each cluster and try to make a standard label for each cluster from there. However I am not sure what the best means to cluster mixed data is or if this is really the best route.

The hypothetical situation is that, you have a website where users write let's say movie reviews. So there are in general two types of users on your website, the ones who write normal amount like the rest of us, and the ones who write very often and are so called ""top contributors"".

Now the question is, how would you, using data, to define who are ""top contributors""?

My idea was that, we'll take the last 24 weeks (\~6 months) data, then we take the average daily contributions per user over each week, then we take average of these averages for each user. Then, with the average rate calculated, we can list out the top contributors overall or for each region. So basically:

for each user:

    daily_avg = [# of contributions]/[# of days]   where [# of days]=7   
    weekly_avg = [sum of daily_avg]/[# of weeks]   where [# of weeks]=24

1. Does my approach make sense?
2. Would love to learn from your better approaches.

3-. Creating a source table. I would execute the query and insert the result in a new table with name like source\_product\_domain. Then I would use ""select \* from source\_product\_domain"" in the selectsql parameter.

Here is the list that I had no time / effort practicing, you can find a dataset yourself and play with it. You can even turn it to a solution that people would need.

* Detecting cigarette stubs: Based on a strong image recognition model, a cleaning machine would enter even a nice garden to spoof stubs without messing plants.
* Open chat-room (like IRLs) with fresh topics: Topics would be inferred using topic modeling (unsupervised learning). New topics would be learned from passed discussions for a limited window (say one day).
* Time suggestion for frequent phone calls: Using history of calls (succeeded, and missed calls) of different communication solutions (WhatsApp, Viber, phone...); Learn a model to suggest a better timing . It would be very useful when peers are in different time-zones.
* Un-Tic: Train a model to discover repetitive -not successful tasks-; Tasks are actions a developer attempted on his IDE ( intellij, eclipse...) but didn't produce anything; As an example, add a line then remove it. I am sure developers do dozens of actions that are just Tics. I do myself add a line then remove it, refresh a project two times, etc. As you can imagine, this would be a plug-in in famous IDEs.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just wondering if this &amp;#39;glut&amp;#39; includes literally &lt;em&gt;every single person&lt;/em&gt; trying to obtain their first job in data engineering/ML/AI having &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; prior experience, or just people who have the bare minimum experience, such as maybe as a few full DataCamp courses, Bootcamp, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the second sentence: of course there&amp;#39;s a shortage of expedience people in an industry where you need to get experience to become established. What makes that different from literally any other industry? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe most of the people in the first category include people in BI/analytics trying to become scientists, but I&amp;#39;m wondering where that places people still in undergrad with degrees like CS/Math. I&amp;#39;m weary of trying to get a job in a field that might be as &amp;quot;glutted&amp;quot; as the first sentence insinuates.&lt;/p&gt;

317,,datascience,"Hi Reddit,

Over the past 6 months I've been working on a technical book focused on helping aspiring data scientists to get hands-on experience with cloud computing environments using the Python ecosystem. The book is targeted at readers already familiar with libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn that are looking to build out a portfolio of applied projects.

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry. 

Here's links to the book, with sample chapters and code listings:

338,,datascience,"So don't get me wrong I hate SAS in general. I have a comp sci degree, have experience coding in many different languages, and get frustrated to no end every time I need to use SAS. I used to work at a job where I used R for 90% of my tasks and now work at a job where I use python for 90% of my tasks. But for all the shit it gets and the fact that it was coded in the 70s? It's still insanely fast and good at certain statistical tasks and medium-large sized data. I was working on a proof of concept to prove to my team python was much better and could replace SAS, and I was struggling. When dealing with small data python was much better, but who cares if you can do your work in 50ms compared to 200ms? When the data got bigger many of the tasks I was trying to replicate with python were so much slower that SAS was actually completing the task faster than python could even read the dataset into memory. I'm actually working on a project I can publish to a public github repo because I couldn't believe it. You would think python would shine with data that's slightly large but fits in memory, but SAS was actually winning this. When we started dealing with big data where python required dataset chunking SAS blew it out of the water performance-wise and obviously time to code-wise, since SAS required no modifications while python required much different code to handle chunks at a time.

  
Maybe there were some optimizations I could make with python to speed it up a bit, and I'm not saying SAS is not going to be obsolete in the next few years, I'm just saying I think a lot of data scientists hate on SAS without understanding the amount of genius that went into it. We're talking about software built in the 70s when large amounts of memory weren't a thing, and it still is out-performing state of the art data science programming software in 2019 for some use cases. I yearn for the day that's not the case and when real programming languages can replicate everything SAS can do, but the fact of the matter is the average r/datascience user scoffs at SAS while there are SAS users making way more money and performing data science tasks much faster and better than them. I much enjoy programming in R or python to SAS, but there are definitely things that SAS does much quicker than either language, which is amazing given the restrictions where it needs to store everything on the disk. Sure if you're an expert python coder you can probably optimize your work better than SAS, but if you're that skilled, you're probably a developer rather than a data scientist. SAS has incredibly fast operations given the flexibility it has and given the restraints of needing to work from the disk rather than memory, and if you're trying to maximize your value as a data scientist you're going to be focusing on things other than coding. If you're looking to be promoted as a data scientist today at a company that has SAS, R, and python, I think you're much more likely to be promoted by spending your time learning more AI/ML algorithms and implementing them in SAS than you are in spending that time optimizing an algorithm or process in R or python. Do you think your boss will be more impressed that you improved the model you own by lowering the adjusted R-squared and now your business can be more confident in its decision-making or will your boss be more impressed that you implemented the same model that's been running for a decade in an open-source programming language?

I have a comp sci degree, have experience coding in many different languages, and get frustrated to no end every time I need to use SAS. I used to work at a job where I used R for 90% of my tasks and now work at a job where I use python for 90% of my tasks. But for all the shit it gets and the fact that it was coded in the 70s? It&amp;#39;s still insanely fast and good at certain statistical tasks and medium-large sized data. I was working on a proof of concept to prove to my team python was much better and could replace SAS, and I was struggling. When dealing with small data python was much better, but who cares if you can do your work in 50ms compared to 200ms? When the data got bigger many of the tasks I was trying to replicate with python were so much slower that SAS was actually completing the task faster than python could even read the dataset into memory.

340,,datascience,"Good afternoon guys and Happy New Year,

I'm working with a sales team in my city where they operate in Business to Business sales, trying to offer the best rates on shipping routes for truckers and trucking companies.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that with management, quotes for a price on routes change on a day to day basis.  The only way their sales force can get updated quotes is through real-time which deals with waiting in line outside the manager's door and trying to run around the facility trying to find him, which is inefficient for the sales team.

&amp;#x200B;

Or sending the manager an email to request for the day's quote, unique to their own route.  But that's inefficient to the manager because he can't spend all day on his phone or computer answering separate emails.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am thinking of is being able to create a spreadsheet that is updated on real time, where it is accessible simply through their networks on a local drive.  This will also be able to collect data for each individual sales rep and track daily routes and rates, something they have not been able to streamline.

The problem I face is two things, having the excel file only be able to be a one way street.  Meaning, the Sales rep can only create an input of the desired quote, maybe be able to answer a series of questions, and it will output that day's quote.  The manager will be able to control the daily quotes, by opening the Master Excel file he only has access to and update the quotes as he sees fit.

&amp;#x200B;

My vision is to be able to have the foundation of an online shopping cart.  Like you know when you shop online on Amazon, you click on the items you want, add them to your shopping cart, and it will give you a quote for the price.  It's reactive and done in real time, where the only control you have is selecting what you want.  You have no control of the actual pricing.  The pricing is controlled by ""upper management"".

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think this is too ambitious, correct me if I'm wrong.  I want to keep it around Excel as I want to minimize the learning curve of introducing a new software to a team, as Excel is a software everyone is familiar with.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, my only problem is, closing that gap between having a separate Excel file all sales reps will have control of, and the Master Excel file only the manager will have control of, where the Master Excel file dictates what the Rep's Excel sheets sees.

&amp;#x200B;

347,,datascience,"Hello,

First of all, sorry for my non-native English.

I was wondering if any of you have health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, RSI or other (probably arthritis comes to mind) in this career.

I've been diagnosed 1 year ago. Quite unfortunate, as I've decided on pursuing a more technical career 2 years ago and just shortly before I started having these problems, found my passion for programming &amp; analytics, which are a huge part of my job (although less rigorous than a Data Scientist or probably even a Data Analyst - I'm doing this from a business perspective).

I'm currently working in hotel Revenue Management, which is very similar to analytics, although less technical, so a better parallel to my work would probably be Product Management (? not sure though), also it has a lot in common with consulting, though my ""clients"" are all inside the same company. I'm paid to make decisions, forecast, analyze (less so since I got an analyst to help me 1 year ago), and attend a lot of meetings with the management + report...

I felt like I finally found some meaning to life, something I'm passionate about. And recently even got an offer for a job as a BI Developer within my company, building directly upon my domain knowledge, which would move me closer to a more technical job. But I turned it down, because my health problems have been getting worse (+ other non-related negatives, it's not just because of the health, but that's a part of it).

I guess the bottom line is this - how much of a problem might these health problems be - given it won't get better in time (it hasn't in the past 1-2 years)? I'm still using a keyboard and mouse in my current job, but my fear is that a more technical job will make me use them a lot more, so making my carpal tunnel  + RSI even worse.

But I might be wrong and maybe a lot of time is spent thinking about models, thinking about coding and so on. And less time clicking the mouse. I don't really have trouble with writing, it's more using the mouse. Currently have an analyst who makes most reports for me, so I don't need to do too much with the mouse. As a BI  Dev, clicking around in Tableau + Excel the whole day it would definitely be worse.

So, my choices are either:

1) follow my passion and risk getting a job in a technical sector - Data Analyst, Junior DS, Data Engineer...

2) continue what I'm doing and go towards management in my sector, which I'm not so passionate about but I may not have another choice, looking 10 years in the future (I'm afraid Revenue Managers will get replaced by machine anyway)

3) maybe  a middle ground - get a job in the data sector, but choose one specialization which uses the least amount of mouse (and ideally keyboard, but this is just future-proofing - currently I don't have so much problems with writing, as I mentioned). so maybe a Product Manager? (not sure if possible without actual Data Science experience, even though my job is quite related).

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if any of you have health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, RSI or other (probably arthritis comes to mind) in this career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed 1 year ago. Quite unfortunate, as I&amp;#39;ve decided on pursuing a more technical career 2 years ago and just shortly before I started having these problems, found my passion for programming &amp;amp; analytics, which are a huge part of my job (although less rigorous than a Data Scientist or probably even a Data Analyst - I&amp;#39;m doing this from a business perspective).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently working in hotel Revenue Management, which is very similar to analytics, although less technical, so a better parallel to my work would probably be Product Management (? not sure though), also it has a lot in common with consulting, though my &amp;quot;clients&amp;quot; are all inside the same company. I&amp;#39;m paid to make decisions, forecast, analyze (less so since I got an analyst to help me 1 year ago), and attend a lot of meetings with the management + report...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I finally found some meaning to life, something I&amp;#39;m passionate about. And recently even got an offer for a job as a BI Developer within my company, building directly upon my domain knowledge, which would move me closer to a more technical job. But I turned it down, because my health problems have been getting worse (+ other non-related negatives, it&amp;#39;s not just because of the health, but that&amp;#39;s a part of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line is this - how much of a problem might these health problems be - given it won&amp;#39;t get better in time (it hasn&amp;#39;t in the past 1-2 years)? I&amp;#39;m still using a keyboard and mouse in my current job, but my fear is that a more technical job will make me use them a lot more, so making my carpal tunnel  + RSI even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I might be wrong and maybe a lot of time is spent thinking about models, thinking about coding and so on. And less time clicking the mouse. I don&amp;#39;t really have trouble with writing, it&amp;#39;s more using the mouse. Currently have an analyst who makes most reports for me, so I don&amp;#39;t need to do too much with the mouse. As a BI  Dev, clicking around in Tableau + Excel the whole day it would definitely be worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my choices are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) follow my passion and risk getting a job in a technical sector - Data Analyst, Junior DS, Data Engineer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) continue what I&amp;#39;m doing and go towards management in my sector, which I&amp;#39;m not so passionate about but I may not have another choice, looking 10 years in the future (I&amp;#39;m afraid Revenue Managers will get replaced by machine anyway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) maybe  a middle ground - get a job in the data sector, but choose one specialization which uses the least amount of mouse (and ideally keyboard, but this is just future-proofing - currently I don&amp;#39;t have so much problems with writing, as I mentioned). so maybe a Product Manager? (not sure if possible without actual Data Science experience, even though my job is quite related). Or I was thinking Consulting, but that would probably have me do management consulting, not data consulting (again, no Data Science experience, although I&amp;#39;ve been programming + doing analytics + making strategy, forecasting etc for the past 3 years in my job - just in a less technical/math way than a DS would - I&amp;#39;m a business person, not a statistician - so that&amp;#39;s somewhere in the middle between those two ...)&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a grad student in data science at a major university. I’ve recently been questioning what is the right path for me in the field of data science.

I originally became interested in data science because I was fascinated with the ability to leverage data to surface insights and uncover truths that could drive real-world decision-making and impact. I find much of ML, on the other hand, to be tweaking models and fiddling with things to get those couple of points more of accuracy. It doesn’t feel much like uncovering truth and communicating insights at all. It feels similar to tuning up a car.  

I was wondering what paths are available for more insights-driven data science. It seems that ML is all the rage and all the jobs/internships out there are for that.

351,,datascience,"Hi, 

I’m currently doing inputting and analysis of questionnaire data and don’t really have much influence over the wording of the questions or the possible answers. Because the person collecting the data doesn’t really know anything about statistics / DA they are doing things which are seriously affecting the quality of the data (for example, changing the bins for answers between rounds of surveys) or adding options like ‘all my time’ for answers that are otherwise numerical. On the one hand the question changing reflect the changing understanding of the topic and it’s most likely useful for them to find out more specific info, but it obviously makes amalgamation of the rounds of questionnaires harder / less valid. 

So I’ve tried to explain about not changing answer options, why you can and can’t do with cat/num variables etc etc but it’s hard to impress this without them having a better understanding of statistics. For slightly more complex reasons it’s not possible for me to take over the design / implementation of said questionnaires, so I’m basically just left reacting to what I’m given. 

It definitely doesn’t come from a lack of interest / caring (they recently hand coded a load of questionnaire info for me, when I could’ve run it through a script in seconds...). So it’s mainly to do with dealing with people who aren’t used to coding / DA and what is and isn’t possible and what is and isn’t helpful. Does anyone have any methods they’ve found helpful?

My team is about to launch a group of binary classification data science models. And I was looking at a side project to monitor these models and the underlying datasets. After researching this subreddit and reading a plethora of articles online, I really haven't found a solution for it. I am looking to:

1. Be notified of any shifts in the dataset.
2. Be notified of any significant decreases in model performance.
3. And if there is a decrease in performance, identify what underlying shifts in the data have caused this.

After researching this subreddit and reading a plethora of articles online, I really haven&amp;#39;t found a solution for it. I am looking to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Be notified of any significant decreases in model performance.&lt;/li&gt;

I've read through a bunch of post from other people asking for guidance and advice on courses to take, and am a bit overwhelmed on what topic or online course would be best to start with. Its a bit confusing given how new the field is and the different approaches people take.

I am a senior Computer Science student, so I feel pretty familiar with Python, Java, C, etc. and feel comfortable with my ability to learn new languages.

Also, I have done well learning on my own and moving ahead in my career. That said, I feel that my B.S. in physics will hold me back soon enough. My company has begun hiring MS and PhDs recently (for other depts. but it won't be long)  and I think I better make sure I get the qualifications even if I think I can learn it on my own.

So, I'm looking for online programs that would teach me, but mostly do as the qualification, along the lines of applied stats/applied machine learning.

Good Background: I was an analyst at a fin-tech firm and then moved into building data infrastructure at an ad-tech firm. It's almost fully a SWE role except it takes a little stats to understand the projects that are being put into production. We're probably a couple years away from putting some good ML into production and I'd like to be a solid part of that journey (plenty or work to do in the meantime). I did some computational physics but at an undergrad level. Most math doesn't scare me and I'm willing to do pre-reqs. Almost anytime I've been asked to do something I've said, 'yep, I can do that', and then managed to learn well enough to do it ok. It's not the best or how everyone would do it but it's served me well.

Bad Background: I was a below average student at a no-name state school. I'm capable but don't have a good academic record whatsoever. Repeated several math courses. All due to lack of direction and apathy at the time.

I absolutely want to learn as much as possible but I just don&amp;#39;t think I can get into a great program. Also, I have done well learning on my own and moving ahead in my career. That said, I feel that my B.S. in physics will hold me back soon enough. My company has begun hiring MS and PhDs recently (for other depts. but it won&amp;#39;t be long)  and I think I better make sure I get the qualifications even if I think I can learn it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m looking for online programs that would teach me, but mostly do as the qualification, along the lines of applied stats/applied machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Background: I was an analyst at a fin-tech firm and then moved into building data infrastructure at an ad-tech firm. It&amp;#39;s almost fully a SWE role except it takes a little stats to understand the projects that are being put into production. We&amp;#39;re probably a couple years away from putting some good ML into production and I&amp;#39;d like to be a solid part of that journey (plenty or work to do in the meantime). I did some computational physics but at an undergrad level. Most math doesn&amp;#39;t scare me and I&amp;#39;m willing to do pre-reqs. Almost anytime I&amp;#39;ve been asked to do something I&amp;#39;ve said, &amp;#39;yep, I can do that&amp;#39;, and then managed to learn well enough to do it ok. It&amp;#39;s not the best or how everyone would do it but it&amp;#39;s served me well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad Background: I was a below average student at a no-name state school. I&amp;#39;m capable but don&amp;#39;t have a good academic record whatsoever. Repeated several math courses. All due to lack of direction and apathy at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has been in a similar position (poor record but good discipline and ability) and managed to level up to an MS has advice, I&amp;#39;d be a happy to listen! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

427,,datascience,"Someone recently asked me in a comment what skills I would recommend for Data Scientists looking to transition to ML Engineering, so wrote down a quick list and thought it might deserve its own post.

It looks like a lot but bear in mind that I learned all of these gradually over the last 3 years “on the job” to solve specific problems (i.e. I didn’t do any of these as “independent study” before getting my first ML Engineering role). So in terms of ""skills needed to transition"", I would actually say all you need is a ""hacker mindset"" and the ability to learn quickly/independently.

My list:

* HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React
   * Data labeling apps
   * Prototypes/mockups
   * Integrating models into existing webapps
* Java/C#/Ruby
   * Integrating models into existing backend services
* C/C++
   * Customizing &amp; Extending open-source ML libraries=
* Docker/Kubernetes/AWS
   * Deploying models
* Jenkins/Buildkite
   * Automating model build/deployment pipelines
* Kafka/SQS/Datadog/ELK/Bugsnag
   * Building &amp; Debugging distributed applications

&lt;p&gt;It looks like a lot but bear in mind that I learned all of these gradually over the last 3 years “on the job” to solve specific problems (i.e. I didn’t do any of these as “independent study” before getting my first ML Engineering role). So in terms of &amp;quot;skills needed to transition&amp;quot;, I would actually say all you need is a &amp;quot;hacker mindset&amp;quot; and the ability to learn quickly/independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data labeling apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototypes/mockups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating models into existing webapps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java/C#/Ruby

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating models into existing backend services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/C++

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customizing &amp;amp; Extending open-source ML libraries=&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins/Buildkite

429,,datascience,"Hi reddit,

Background: I'm a data scientist for a medium-sized company. In some of my personal data science work, I've ran into some annoyances which corporate infrastructure/offloading to AWS usually handles.

In particular, the following needs:

1) Data storage

* Currently have a couple SSDs and a 1TB HD in my personal computer, looking to scale quite a bit (with backup/security).

2) Remote access / persistence of work across locations

* Jupyter server (or other notebook server(s))
* Virtual machines (esp. Linux)

3) Running chron jobs

* I do a bit of frequent web-scraping

4) Future web-hosting / FTP access?

* Currently my personal work is for fun/friend's work, but I am looking to consult/freelance in the future

Number 2 has definitely been felt while traveling for holidays, where I do not have access to my PC, but do have several devices for remote access. The two options I'm currently considering for the above needs are:


A) Build a home server and set up that would accomplish all of the above (or at least 1-3). Hopefully also with the benefit of using as a home media server :)

* I'd likely move my existing PC's GPU into the server for deep learning in the future.


B) Buy a commercial NAS, suck it up and use AWS for work I expect to need to access remotely.

Has anyone had success with using a home server for data science work? Or another approach I have not thought of?

439,,datascience,"I apologize in advance if anything I say is controversial. I'm genuinely curious about the future of this line of career and don't mean to offend anyone from any country.

I'm currently 29M, about to finish my PhD in a STEM field. A huge lesson I've learned, being involved in research, startups and big corporations is that programmers and coders are just a workforce, which can be bought, used and then put on the shelf. The availability of good programmers is growing every year, especially with most software tools being freely available and huge competition from programmers from developing countries such as India and China. Additionally, I can clearly see things headed towards automation of programming.  Expertise in a tool-set might lead to short-term job prospects, but one can easily be replaced/automated. I'm planning a career in medical data-science. The deep learning models I'm building now for my PhD won't be a novelty very soon as computers get more powerful and infrastructures are setup to perform standard machine learning and deep learning at the click of a button/ call of a function, instead of needing to develop them in Tensorflow/PyTorch/Caffe/Scikit-Learn/R. Platforms such as R, Weka etc are headed that way currently.

There's a few things I've figured which will be difficult to automate and requires domain expertise and good communication skills. I'd love any comments on the following ways to secure a good career for the next 10-15 years. This is pure speculation of course:

1. Data Engineer: Expertise in the pre-learning stage, involving data pre-processing, cleaning, feature building  and maintenance of the data pipeline. This requires domain knowledge and cannot easily be performed by a generic data-scientist. This seems to be the most technically challenging and interesting.
2. Data Analyst: Great communication skills to convince the stakeholders/managers using the information provided by the data scientist. This seems quite future-proof however, the job focus seems to shift more towards communication, relying on soft-skills with a good working knowledge of data science. Requires good understanding of statistics. But having seen my friends attend multiple meetings trying to explain the meaning of statistics to the managers, I'm not sure this one is for me. 
3. Manager: Managing a team of data engineers, scientists, analysts. One level removed from the analysts. Less involvement with technology and more with people management skills. Personally, this doesn't interest me. I can see the appeal of this position for others though.
4. Data Scientist: Feel like this is at most risk of being automated. The models being used can be put in a standard infrastructure for ensemble methods, making the process of creating models from scratch redundant. Hyper-customized models however, would still be in demand.
5. Multi-disciplinary Data Science Application Engineer: This has been the most interesting discovery. Use of machine learning/statistical/deep learning techniques to develop a model that can be used as part of another ecosystem. For example, using a well-trained NLP sentiment analyzer for prediction of body posture and using MoCap for validation. Essentially, combining multiple technologies for building a product, instead of pure data-science for reporting/business intelligence. My PhD has been along these lines so far.

Hope I'm thinking along the correct lines. Seeing the fast changing ecosystem of A.I./M.L./Data-science got me thinking about future career prospects as I enter the stage in my life to increase my focus on building a family and providing for them. Thus, limiting the amount of time I can dedicate to keeping on top of technologies/trends and require career stability. I'm extremely open to any suggestions/criticisms/corrections.

445,,datascience,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",t2_3epw0pud,False,,1,False,Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,[],r/datascience,False,6,,0,False,t3_edgai0,False,dark,,public,614,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,614,,False,,1576895992.0,seniorflair,[],"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1576905806.0,text,6,,,text,self.datascience,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I&amp;#39;ve seen people make is how they measure their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corollary 2: if you&amp;#39;re right but it doesn&amp;#39;t change the outcome, then it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corollary 3: if you&amp;#39;re right, but it doesn&amp;#39;t work, then you&amp;#39;re wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn&amp;#39;t, then they&amp;#39;re right and you&amp;#39;re wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corollary 5: if you prove someone&amp;#39;s solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things that a person sees as &amp;quot;wrong science&amp;quot; work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not actually wrong, and the person just doesn&amp;#39;t understand why it&amp;#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not 100% right, but it&amp;#39;s right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn&amp;#39;t wrong, it&amp;#39;s just 95% right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won&amp;#39;t work, rather than on it being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

I have experience with programming in Python and Gnuplot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My data is generated on a Linux Debian platform. It consists of 5 columns. The data looks a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Imp.Lo Imp.Hi Int.Us Exp.Lo Exp.Hi
  4      16     80     40     10

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to plot this as a stacked bar. However, I&amp;#39;d like the first three columns to stack &lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; from y=0  and the final two columns to hang (stacked) below y=0. Rows, obviously, each form a new bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools I might consider and/or coding examples are highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

460,,datascience,"Hey guys! :) 

I am a Psychology student and for my final year project at university I designed an experiment that includes my participants doing a behavioral task while I am recording their performance on the task (response time to cues and congruent/incongruent reaction to target) and EEG data. The EEG data will be used for spectrum analysis and event-related potential (related to the cue). 
As I have my experiment now I am expecting to have about ~800 rows per participant and me and my supervisor determined that a good sample size would be about 15-20 (20 is impossibly good to attain, and 15 is the best realistically speaking. 

My question is - Is it possible if I get 5 participants - ~4,000 rows of data to get the probability distribution from my data and generate a larger dataset based on said prob dist? Are there any other ways to generate a meaningful dataset?

I'm working with pretty big data. We've collected over 450M records since the launch of our product mid-late this summer. I want to report this data for our stakeholders using Tableau, but as you can imagine the performance of these dashboards is slow. I'm not sure the best option to resolve this.

&amp;#x200B;

The data is stored in a transactional system now, so should we spend time creating a data warehouse for efficient reporting? My concern here is that we don't have a dedicated data engineer, or DBA, so I would need to maintain this system.

&amp;#x200B;

Should we create summary tables with aggregated information and only present that? My concern here is that we lose insight through aggregation and stakeholders may want to dive deeper than our aggregated data allows.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I take some other approach?

504,,datascience,"There is a representation problem for graphs when you are studying a collection of them (like a bunch of molecules in the case of drug discovery). It is no longer relevant to consider their standard representation via their [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) because of labelling issues. For machine learning, this means you need to replace graphs with a vector representation that transcribes their essential properties (independently of how many vertices your graph has). This can be done with a nice trick presented by a Stanford group called [graph wave](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphwave/). Studying the heat diffusion on graph allows to build a vector representation that neatly encodes for structural properties of a graph (thanks to the topological properties of the laplacian). 

The idea behind [graph-wave](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphwave/) is to simulate how a unit of heat spreads from one vertex to all the other vertices of the graph. We can then represent a vertex as vector by taking the graph's entropy over numerous time-steps. A hub node will diffuse the heat very rapidly, whereas an isolated vertex will retain a lot of the heat locally. 

As a master project, we extended the results of graph-wave to build the same representation but this time for the edges of the graph. The process required a bit of TDA (which is now contained in [Giotto](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-learn)).

We tested this method on detecting HIV inhibiting molecules on the [Moleculenet](http://moleculenet.ai/) database. You can read more about it over [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-shape-of-chemical-functions-d1e1568d020)📚! [Code here](https://github.com/giotto-ai/the-shape-of-chemical-functions).

We can then represent a vertex as vector by taking the graph&amp;#39;s entropy over numerous time-steps. A hub node will diffuse the heat very rapidly, whereas an isolated vertex will retain a lot of the heat locally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a master project, we extended the results of graph-wave to build the same representation but this time for the edges of the graph. The process required a bit of TDA (which is now contained in &lt;a href=""https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-learn""&gt;Giotto&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested this method on detecting HIV inhibiting molecules on the &lt;a href=""http://moleculenet.ai/""&gt;Moleculenet&lt;/a&gt; database. You can read more about it over &lt;a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/the-shape-of-chemical-functions-d1e1568d020""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;📚! &lt;a href=""https://github.com/giotto-ai/the-shape-of-chemical-functions""&gt;Code here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom of the line: only shape information with very basic info gets 1 AuRoc point away from state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;

522,,datascience,"Data scientists appeared about 12 years ago, and they were essentially a bunch of people using statistical and software tools to solve business problems involving lots of data, often unconventional. It wasn't just about creating models and deploying code to production. Finding problems, defining them, communicating with stakeholders — those were also part of the job, and probably the bigger part. Those first jobs weren't held by computer geeks. They were held by computer geeks with excellent communication skills and business acumen. 

Fast forward to present time. I see most (actually pretty much all) candidates focus on their model building skills, but they have little (if any) business acumen or interest in developing it. Asked point blank, they say they are interested in building models. They have no interest in business development. Now, there is nothing wrong with being a data engineer, but I find it puzzling that so many candidates don't consider going into the ""classical"" data science role. I know many companies these days offer data science positions in which business development isn't expected because it's taken care of by the higher-ups, but I'm curious why incomers aren't interested in that side of the job given the opportunity. 

From my personal perspective, any data scientist who aspires to grow should take on business-related responsibilities. Technical skills alone **may** elevate someone above their immediate peers, but why stop at that? Ultimately, above every data scientists, there's a ""suit"". Finally, there is this curiosity aspect. How can one be content with not seeing the bigger picture?

It's fairly open-ended, basically I'm looking for something fun to do on the side that helps me improve my data science and collaboration skills as well as create something cool that people would find valuable, plus we could show friends and family who wonder wtf we do all day and it wouldn't look terrible on a resume. Here's what I was thinking:  


1. Model building - year-long model to predict draft value as well as single-week model to predict points scored per game for use in sit/start decisions, waiver wire decisions, and mid-season trades. Maybe separate models for single-week and rest of the season? idk would need to think that through. Every time I see the espn projections I just keep thinking I could do better and I want to know if that's actually true.  


2. Visualization - The sky is the limit here really, but for example I've done a few things with my league: a box and whisker plot of all the team's points scored on the year, an ""if you played all other teams every week here's how it would look"" chart along with the difference between that winning percentage and your actual winning percentage, I did a new one this year where every week I simulated the rest of the year if teams were of equal skill and estimated playoff probabilities,  I was thinking maybe one that rates trades at the time of the trade (based on the model) and then shows actual results as the season progresses, I'm sure you can come up with a bunch of other valuable visualizations. Basically I'm trying to create a tool where the user could maybe enter their espn/yahoo league id and it could create visuals for their league that would be valuable and/or fun.  


So anyway, this is a ton of work and I already have a full-time job and other commitments and I was hoping to have something of value by next season, so I'd like to find some people to help collaborate on the project. Are there people who would be interested? Feel free to post here or shoot me a pm.

A quick bio of me I have a computer science undergrad degree and have worked as a quantitative analyst at a major bank for \~5 years now and have worked on a variety of different financial models.

I'd prefer python because that's what I use in my current role but I've used R in the past and know js and java as well.

538,,datascience,"The story goes that my company had an old database of in-house and citizen-scientist plant observations hosted on their website 5 years ago. We since moved to a different platform for our data which is much better but last year I started digging into our old Access database to clean it up and merge with our current data and do some analysis.

The problem is that when we took down the web-hosted database 5 years ago no one knew what happened to it. I was given the best version of the database they could find (ca. 2014) and I set to work cleaning out bad entries, finding missing fields, etc etc. I also was given a handful of old paper datasheets which had never made it into the old database so I added those to my 'clean' version of the 2104 data. Low and behold, I was still missing a substantial amount of data because it wasn't the most up-to-date version when they switched methods.

Finally, two days ago, someone found the 'complete' version of the web-hosted database (ca. 2015) with the previously mentioned 'substantial amount of missing data' in it. I can re-run the cleaning methods I'd used before since those are all scripted, but now I've got the paper datasheets with their own keys in the 2014 clean version to bring into the 2015 and those will have a handful of conflicts with keys.

In short I have three versions of this database (2014, 2015, and 2014_clean with additional entries on present in either 2014 or 2015) and no clue where to start with unifying them.

Maybe just apply all my data cleaning methods to the 2015 version so it'll be equivalent to the good data in 2014 then re-index the paper data entered to 2014_clean to the latest numbers in 2015 and concat it on for each table?

I am a machine learning intern. We have a labelling problem in which we want to cluster strings into category ""Something"" and category ""Not Something"".

I tried to gently assert that even though they're numbers, that doesn't mean that they're quantitative data - is the average of B and D, C? (He answered yes to that, btw.). 

I told him if the word 'apple' appears in the beginning of the string and in the other row appears in the end of the string, it won't be put in the same cluster necessarily.

""That's not how support vector machines work."" ""Oh really, how many have you done?"" 

I ran it anyway - it gives results with 98% accuracy because in this case ""Something"" and ""Not Something"" tend to have radically different lengths.

I learned last summer that I really have a passion for data science and decided I would try for that for my next internship. Last year I got 5+ interviews right away when I applied to local software engineering internships, so I figured okay I will be able to get  something, I am capable and hard working. Turns out that's not true and nobody wants to hire me even though I hold a lot of the qualifications for a data science internship. I've applied to over 60 places since August and have gotten over 15 rejections so far and only one place was willing to give me a coding test which they rejected me after. I am so  downtrodden and defeated, I have no clue what I am doing wrong.

I've  talked to multiple professors, HR at work, career services, and they all have said that I am doing everything right in their eyes. I'm starting research next semester with my AI professor and I am planning to make a chatbot over winter break, so those will help my skills but I am not sure how much of that I can really even show off on a job application. I am also retaking the AI class I already took and got an A in because my professor is changing it to include machine learning. I'm also taking some 400 level stats classes next year.

Eventually I want to go to grad school for data science. I just want to start now gaining experience because I really enjoy doing and learning abut this stuff. Am I just not competitive enough? I know I don't have much experience but isn't that want an internship is for? It's so so so disheartening, it's really hard not to question my capability of being in this field and if I should just stick with software engineering.

As the title says, my boyfriend works with data science. 
I've seen him working, I've seen his lectures, he preparing his classes to his students, I've seen the website of the company where he works, and listened to data science podcasts where he was a special guest.

I don't work in the same area, and even after doing all of this, I can't understand ANY SINGLE WORD of what his work is.
I see him typing in a dark screen and sending messages to his co-workers of what I call ""writing in Cthulhu language"".
I know he has some stickers on his notebook and I thought it was because he wanted to make it cuter, but then he told me each of them have a meaning and means something he can work with.

There are so many, I remember there being a deer, the octocat (I really liked this one) and the Python snakes (which I say it means he can talk snake language and speak with snakes), but I forgot all the others, and I won't be able to see him until his birthday on Saturday.

The thing is, he absolutely LOVES puzzles and solving puzzles and problems and in order for him to open his birthday gift (which will be locked with a 3-digit padlock) I'm making a test that he needs to solve various kinds of questions that can't be googled in order to advance to the next question and finally reach the ""ultimate hint"" for the padlock password.

I wanted to make some really hard questions/problems for him to solve in the area of his work, the kind that he would really need to put his brains to work out to solve, but I'm a total illiterate about data science, so I need your guys help, please give me some problems/questions and their answers for me to make this puzzle!

579,,datascience,"TLDR: New fresh-grad MSc. in my first job as an Associate Data Scientist. Responsibilities grew to that of a normal Senior Data Scientist within 6 months and will double by the beginning of next year. If a promotion isn't possible, how can I make the most of my situation, whether increasing compensation, refusing too much work, etc?

Hi guys,

I'm in a bit of precarious situation and I hope you guys would be able to help. I'm a new age Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/R/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but no data engineering or production-level ML modeling). At the beginning of this year, I left academia (previously PhD. Candidate) with an MSc. in electrical engineering. I applied and was accepted into a big funded start-up (think Alibaba level). From the long interview process, I was rated as barely a Senior DS; worried that I couldn't keep up due to my lack of experience, I pushed to become an Associate DS with a salary close to a Senior DS (based on my market analysis), which was accepted.

However, in the span of 6 months, I went from working with 1 Product Manager (PM) with 1 product to 2 PMs with 3 products. Now, by end of January, due to reorgs (no layoffs though), I'm now asked to **solely** handle 6 PMs with 9 products. According to my company's DS career ladder, I'm qualified to be a Senior DS when I work with 2-3 PMs and 4+ products, and these requirements are pretty consistent with the actual responsibilities of the Senior DSs I'm friends with. However, my manager has already stated that while a promotion is ""on the table"", I likely don't have the work experience nor enough time spent in the company to be considered for a promotion yet. Promotions requires multiple levels of approval, so it isn't purely based on my manager's discretion.

If a promotion isn't possible anytime soon, is it possible to ask for a salary increase or refuse part of the increased responsibilities? My responsibilities and products has increased dramatically in terms of scale, scope, and complexity (from minor, add-on features to features handling a ton of our revenue), let alone dealing with constant stakeholder management and context switching due to the highly varied products. I want to accept the increased responsibilities, but I myself am not sure whether I can handle everything; I feel like my current limit is 5-6 products, but I did grow from struggling with 1 product to comfortably handling 3 products in 4 months. Would talking to the Head of DS department help? We have done multiple skip level meetings in the past, but not for a sensitive topic like this.

What would you do in my situation? Let me know if there's a better place to ask for advice. I think this is an appropriate place due to being relatable and maybe a question on many DS's minds, given the constant influx of new talent into the industry.

EDIT: During my salary negotiation, it was agreed upon that I would mostly be  working at local-level projects, so I was given a local salary. My MSc. is from a top 20 US university, but I work in a 3rd world country, while the headquarters is at a 1st world country; thus, my salary is 4-5x less than my headquarters counterparts. In my last quarter, I was indeed only working on 1 local product/feature. However, this quarter, I worked on 1 local and 1 regional-level product/feature. I needed to fly to the headquarters cross-country at least once  a week per month. Now, by the end of January, they'll be expecting me to work on 1 local and 8 regional products/features.

3. SAP has their own tools in data science, for example predictive analytics and modelling software. It'll be easier for me to learn them since I am in the same industry - but will that help me in the long learn? Will the learning lose value once I am out of this particular field?

My project is to predict the ranking of the English Premier league. The image above is my final predicted rankings using different methods in addition to the true rankings.

This is a 1D plot showing the relative order of the teams, the values are not really important but the order is.

In the plot above, I just used Seaborn's scatter plot and modified the points itself. My problem with this plot is that the lines are not clearly distinguishable and the text overlaps and is a bit confusing. It just looks a bit unprofessional.

607,,datascience,"Here at random.ai startup, we’re reaching our late stage of maturity as a company and I want to share some of our keys to success. At random.ai we enthusiastically follow a well-designed execution methodology that has been developed and calibrated over many years. Software development methodologies come and go, and perspectives change. We embrace the Agile SDLC. The beautiful thing about agile is to adopt it, all you have to do is say you’re agile. And the more you talk about being agile, the more agile you are.

In order to achieve lightning fast delivery speed, we jump directly into development and skip the analysis, requirements and design steps (which are common phases in other, less effective, methodologies). In order to ensure alignment and rapid cycle time, we set milestone deadlines and scope before wasting time on understanding the complexity of the business problem at hand. A key success factor is that the decision makers and product/project plan owners have little or no knowledge of the technological challenges that will be encountered during future phases. To build great technology, we strategically organize our execution teams to minimize the number of people who are writing the code. Our rule of thumb is for every one technologist (i.e. developer, engineer or data scientist), there should be at least four non-technical project team members. This will provide the necessary capacity for these additional resources to determine **what** the technologist will do, **when** they should do it by, and most importantly, **how** they should do it. An important characteristic for successful projects is for the project team to collect a backlog of diverse, unrelated, and unclear tasks and assign them to the developers the moment they think of them. The more our developers and data scientists multi-task, the more tasks can be completed.

A core priority for a sustainable revenue stream on existing products is maintenance- the time spent maintaining existing code and pipelines. Our strategy on investing in maintenance is to do none at all - we can maintain a massive pipeline of new product development by not getting bogged down and distracted doing preemptive maintenance on legacy code. We have rapid, lightweight prioritization of fixing legacy code- instead of crawling through old code that’s already working, it’s better to wait for it to break and allow our clients to discover the problem and raise it to us. This makes prioritization incredibly easy- once the problem is raised, we mobilize resources immediately to fix the problem. Again, this aligns with our philosophy that multi-tasking developers are productive developers.

We find that our most successful project teams and middle managers are always thinking of ways create value for clients faster. We even have a special phrase for these internally: ""short cuts"". So many companies fall victim to spending time building extensible, easily modifiable systems that have staying power over time. Those companies are guaranteed to never reach a billion dollar valuation. Things like robust error handling, load/unit/regression testing, modularization of code, documentation- all distractions preventing you from realizing value faster. For example, we recently had a case where we needed to implement a critical bug fix. A sales rep had the idea of a short cut that led to an incredibly fast turn-around of one week- great ideas really do come from anywhere! We know the short cut was decisively faster than the slow traditional route, because we had to do the fix to the same code three times, each took the same amount of time- one week, and the senior developer’s original estimate was two weeks! This is the out-of-the-box thinking that separates good companies from great ones.

Any competent person in the data products or AI/ML industry will tell you the same thing- having a well-thought-out data quality strategy is a survival necessity. We achieved a 100% efficiency gain in our quality assurance efforts by removing them entirely from our dev cycle. We haven’t failed a test case since the decision, and we’re getting products out the door faster because of it.

The last, but certainly not least, critical component of our execution methodology and philosophy is our talent. Our people are our greatest asset. After years of trying out different org structures- we have, what I believe to be, the truly optimal structure and our key to success is our management team. With respect to head count, we like to have as many mid-level managers as individual contributors. This ensures our individual contributors have the support they need: one half of the company is working tirelessly to support the other half who is doing actual work. Our managers really roll up their sleeves and get into the weeds- really managing all the way down at the most micro level possible.

I hope that you too can gain success using these philosophies and strategies I’ve shared. Here at random.ai, we’re excited to be disrupting the future of cloud native, deep learning powered blockchain knowledge graph data lakes - our CNDLPBKGDL offering which is releasing to beta next year. We’re disrupting the world by disrupting ourselves- because at random.ai, we're solving yesterday’s problems tomorrow, because tomorrow, today will be yesterday.

1. Not qualified

Usually early stage startups with a complex business. They need a unicorn that has more experience and depth of knowledge than me. I would probably love to work for whoever they hire.

2. Philosophical differences

Most of my experience is using Bayesian methods or neural networks. This has been an issue twice as some people consider these heterodox methods. That’s ok, I wouldn’t accept an offer from someone who sees things this way anyways.

3. Credentialism (generally a screening issue)

I do not have a masters degree in Data Science. I have a bachelor’s in business analytics and MIS. I have verifiable experience in launching two successful systems that were strategic enough to have C level oversight, but unfortunately no MS which is a dealbreaker for some HR screeners.

4.  Unexpected Interview Questions/Level

The latest tech interview I went into, I prepped on different analysis and testing methods. I focused a lot on multilevel modeling and made sure I could implement and explain the mcmc algorithm from scratch.

Most of the questions were about sql functions and the difference between joins. I have a DBA certification. I know all of that really well, but hadn’t prepped articulating it on the spot, so I’m sure I sounded lame explaining it.

5. Diversity &amp; Culture 

It’s a no go for me if the team is all “same dude, different guy.”

Also, if I’m gonna spend a significant amount of time with people, I want to be really sure that they are decent. This is the hardest thing to assess though.

6. Location

I do not want to live in NYC or SF, but I still want to work on something that has a good brand, real impact, and is complex. Hard to find positions like this in other cities.

643,,datascience,"Hi,

I am a final year university student in Montreal studying actuarial mathematics as my major. Recently, after 2 internships, I realized I wasn't too interested in this career path and started to look at data science. In my final year, I started taking as many courses as I could in CSci to potentially be considered for a masters in CSci and have applied to some CS Masters but from what I have been hearing, it is very unlikely I get in considering my math background, regardless of my grades.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have 3 options at this point in time that I would like help with if anyone has any suggestions. 

1) Forget Data Science or any other career path and continue as an actuary. I would really like to avoid this option but it is a safe option, good pay and I can work right after university since I have 2 internships and 3 professional exams done. The work isn't interesting to me as much as I thought it would be but if my hand is forced financially, I'll have to do this and companies will pressure to complete actuary specific exams instead of getting a masters or any other education.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Look for any other job as closely related to DSci as possible. Data analyst? Could I even do software/CS jobs? Anything else? In this case I wouldn't know how to finally end up asap in a DSci role and what kind of skills I could build without university courses. (Self-learning is good and all but a lot of companies in DSci list a Master's in CS at the top of the list)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Apply for a master's in CS and keep applying while working until I get in. I don't know how this option would work... would I just apply to my local universities in the city I find a job or do I apply anywhere and drop my job once I get in and move for my Masters?

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, if anyone could put themselves in my shoes and let me know what you would do, I'd appreciate it. I can self learn forever but I need some kind of goal that I believe will land me a job in Data Science and without a Masters, not only do I not see it happening easily, I would guess I would also be unable to advance within any companies without a higher level of education.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very lost on what to do next and I might have to stick to being an actuary if I  don't see a clear path with Data Science. All advice and criticism is appreciated.

My dataset consists of 5 performance attributes and 5 categorical attributes (so 10 columns total).

Basically every other place I've done DS at has had the transactional data pipelined into a dedicated analytics data warehouse where people can then hammer the system there. 

I've talked with the team and they adamantly don't want to push the data into Redshift, but the limitations of MySQL 5.6 are truly frustrating for me tactically building datasets to use for analytics/ML.

668,,datascience,"This is my problem: I'm building a service that receives data in the form of a survey and, when a user requests it, returns a `.pdf` that is the result of processing all the data through a Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is the same, what changes is the data, that should be updated with the newest surveys that add up.

Since the processing of the Notebook can take some time, I'd like to know if there's a way to build a sort of pipeline that helps update the results (that is, the execution of the Notebook) faster. Otherwise I'm left with processing the results in a schedule and leaving the clients receiving outdated results until the next time the Notebook runs.

I am learning ML and have made a model with travel data, with very poor accuracy. I have tried lots of different things -feature selection, deep learning with keras, dropping features, different algos...but I can't get it higher than 10%. I am sure I am doing something stupid or wrong but I am not sure what. 
It's a multi label classification problem. I have travel data for each individual and then a destination they went to. 
With the test set, I need to be able to predict their destination based on the rest of the data.
Where can I ask this question so someone reviews my model? It's neatly annotated in Jupyter. I sense a pro would see the problem in 5 mins! Thanks in advance.

The best way to start working on this probably is looking to the raw data and start fixing the data types, deleting unnecessarily columns, etc. After that I'll explore the correlations between variables, you all probably know the drill.

I'm going to do the above the conventional way in R. But I was wondering, just out of curiosity, is there any tool (preferably free / open source), where I can input the data set and it will try to clean the data and search for correlations without much user input?

680,,datascience,"**TL;DR:** what tools do you use to classify and manage in-house NLP datasets?

I've figured my team is spending a lot of time labelling datasets in somewhat inefficient ways. It happens in Jupyter notebooks (through once-off programmed widgets) or exporting to Excel and back, which is fine but inefficient. For example, having to choose which label is correct among 100 labels is difficult and visually impossible in Excel. It'd be great if some other model ordered these options upfront (I am aware of the bias).

Since I am the one who usually helps them with tools like that, I'd like to see what you use for such tasks before I present them different options.

**We usually work on:**

* text classification
* text annotation
* search results quality evaluation.

Ideally, it would manage datasets and have them available through API so we can spend some time labelling and then just doing something like \`toolx.datasets.fetch(name)\` and use it in Jupyter.

I am not asking for the perfect tool but your experience on tools and workflows you use within your team/company.

683,,datascience,"Paper Abstract: 

Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.

I'm about to apply to masters programs in analytics/data science for the upcoming fall and am wondering if I have a chance of getting into a prestigious program. I'd like to get an analytics degree at either Georgia Tech, Northwestern, or North Carolina State.

My hindrance is that my undergrad GPA in industrial engineering was fairly low (3.24/4) from a large state school (Auburn). However, I have a GRE quantitative score of 166 and just finished a six month contract as a quantitative analyst for a fortune 50 company (and have started a subsequent six month contract at the same position). Additionally, I have an undergraduate research paper based on statistics that is currently in revision review for getting published. I hope it gets published in the next couple of weeks so I can put that on my application. My question is: do I have enough to get into the schools listed above? I'd really like to further my learning and I think a degree from one of these programs could be huge for my career.

708,,datascience,"So I currently work as a data scientist, and I recently failed a data science job interview at a large professional services firm. 

The feedback from my interview was that I came across very well, but that I failed on the technical test.

The technical test was to do a Powerpoint presentation of how I would deduplicate a dataset of 10 million rows which contains information such as name, address ect where some of the rows are fuzzy duplicates of other rows. There was no limit placed on the type of approach or packages used. The task was presented as a business problem, 'we need to call individuals in the dataset to get consent to keep their data, we don't want to call the same individual more than once. We have an approaching deadline.'

My approach was to preprocess the data,  split it into chunks, deduplicate a chunk, and then systematically compare the deduplicated chunk with other chunks, and iterate the same process through the remaining chunks.

In the feedback from the interview they said the main reason why I failed is that for the within-chunk-deduplication and comparison-with-other-chunks parts of the process I used a [pre-built package](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#introduction) rather than building one from scratch myself.

To me, building one myself is a waste of time, as I would just be recreating something that already exists. But obviously they thought I did the wrong thing. 

In case something like this comes up again, I would be interested to hear what others think, did I do wrong by using an existing package? Or did they do wrong by expecting candidates to approach the task and not try to time-optimise the approach?

I am working on deploying a shiny app in my client's environment. The main use case as we understand is that they want to be able to access the app from any computer on their network.

What are the cons of this? Would it affect the speed of the app if too many concurrent users are hitting the app at the same time? Also, would access control be possible through this?

712,,datascience,"The purpose of this post is conversational. I have a regression project I'm about to dive into and I have some nuances around it and some different approaches that I'm considering. So, I wanted to put them out there and see what others think or how they would tackle this problem.

I'm working with app data. When someone installs the app we hope that they become a spender. 

The goal is to build a model to predict 30 day spend based on in app activity after 7 days. For simplicity say there are two predictors only, time spent in total within the first 7 days and then any spend after 7 days. Based on these two data points can we predict what spend will be after 30 days.

The part I'm grappling with in my mind is that suppose only 1% of users ever spend at all. So my data set is heavily skewed.

Here's some approaches that I'm thinking of:

1. Ignore that skew and just build a model anyway. The majority of cases will have 0 for the second predictor '7 day spend'. This approach is appealing because it's simple and requires less work.
2. Use upsampling to pull up more spenders in my training set. This is appealing because in r's caret package, it's as simple as adding a single parameter to train().
3. Build two models. First take those players with any spend after 30 days and build a regression model based on their day 7 behaviors as discussed above.   
Then, for the larger group of non spenders build a classification model with a binary outcome of spend/not spend after 30 days. Then, for each install take the predicted probability of spend and multiply by the regression output for a user with the same level of engagement in terms of time spent in the app. This approach is more work and might get more complicated so it's less appealing, however it 'feels like it might be a more comprehensive approach to handle the large group of non spenders.

What are some ways of handling large skew in regression modeling where the vast majority of cases are 0?

718,,datascience,"I'm currently working with two datasets (real world)

One is customer demographics, such as age, gender, and various census data on their immediate neighborhood.  I've been able to cluster the data based on these census demographics into poor, affluent, student communities, young families etc. and apply these labels to each customer.

The other dataset is their transactions. The transactions are at the store level e.g. spent $20 in this cafe, $50 in this store and so on, so unfortunately I can't really do any sort of market basket analysis or recommend specific products. I could probably build a recommender system based on stores, but I'm not sure if that's commonly done. Every single tutorial I've seen has been at the product level.

I'm just wondering if there are any tools you guys would recommend that I explore in a marketing/customer transaction context.

At the moment I've explored the python lifetimes library: [https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes) to estimate probability of churn, future purchases and customer lifetime value. Very easy to use library with promising results and will stay in my toolkit.

I've also segmented the customers based on RFM scores, didn't take very long to do. However something in the back of my head is telling my this is way too simple.

I've also attempted to build a churn model based on customers who have closed their accounts (4% of the dataset), but results are terrible. I even stuck the data into three different autoML platforms and spent days on feature engineering. I'm getting terrible f-scores. The churn label is very difficult to predict, maximum correlation between variables and churn label is about 0.2.

Anyway, to cut it short: for those in a marketing/data science/data analyst background - any tools/libraries/models you would recommend?

Hi People, 

I'm working on a startup, I have created a reporting tool that accumulates data from 20 different platforms. 

Currently, I’m providing an on-demand solution where I fetch data from APIs whenever a report needs to be generated. 

I want to expand the number of platforms multifold, approx 100. 

Apart from data analytics, I want to provide other advanced features like clubbing data from different platforms, data comparison between platforms, etc. 

To achieve that scale, based on my research and understanding I realized that I need to normalize the data I receive from APIs and store it in my database to provide data analytics on the data apart from just reporting. 

Currently, my application is built on MEAN stack.  

What are the tools/databases I can use to normalize and save the data, are there any predefined standards or basic things which I need to keep in mind before approaching to solve the problem? Is data normalization the right approach or is there any better way?

I work as a zookeeper and one of our tasks is to monitor all the nestboxes of the bird section to keep an eye if there are eggs or chicks, relevant dates, etc. Usually someone has to go around once or twice a week to manually inspect these boxes and gather the required data, which is usually written on a diary and that's it.

I do consulting work for one of the top 3 credit card issuers of USA (any guesses..). We mainly advise our client on strategies best for optimising profitability and reducing losses in the credit card business based on data analytics.

1) Currently, I have the credit card domain knowledge (banking jargons, well they do mean sth) which in itself is very valuable across banks/lending institutions.
2) No cutting edge models are in place in US lending business because of regulatory issues, but this is bound to change sometime in the future and I do not want to get fired if any recession/down sizing happens.
3) I have the fear of being left out when the whole world is transitioning into the complex world of data science and devising unique ways to reduce 'cost functions' where the only USP i have is the domain knowledge and playing with Excel pivots.
4) I can also counter-argue against my own above point that by the time complex data science catches up in the banking sector, I will be high up the ladder enough not to get affected by this (ever see the AVPs, VPs of consulting firms/banks, they don't know what a L1/L2 regularisation is).

What I really want to know is how the clusters are stored and calculated when the dataset is large and possibly incrementing.

2) My question is since this is going to possibly large amount of data, what is the best way to go about this. Should I first calculate smaller clusters like for a day and for single newspapers and then try to construct larger clusters from this smaller cluster set.

3) Also how should I store the already calculated clusters? Possibly a list of ordering between new articles and cluster id?

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to map a sliding window into a higher dimensional space, and study the topology of the aggregated time series. The whole pipeline is explained in this &lt;a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-stock-market-crashes-with-topological-data-analysis-7d5dd98abe42""&gt;medium article&lt;/a&gt;, there is &lt;a href=""https://github.com/giotto-ai/stock-market-crashes""&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, which uses &lt;a href=""https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-learn""&gt;Giotto&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;s time series TDA.&lt;/p&gt;

783,,datascience,"Hi everyone!

I'm pursuing my Master's in DS and I have to do a thesis. My proposal revolves more or less around the idea of mood. It has two parts:

* What semi-constant factors (education, financial status etc.) impact an individual's mood?
* Is there a general trend related to the concept of mood in general for this population or are there any significant correlations with factors found in 1?

I've structured my problem-solving in such a way that it involves a month or so of data collection. I know I could've looked for datasets online but I really wanted to dive deep with this since this is my first thesis and the problem statement is close to my heart since I have mood swings and anxiety issues.

All that said, I'm looking to solve data collection like this:

**Part 1**

&amp;#x200B;

* Ask people to fill an initial survey. My friend is ready to help me with the website. I have some experience too. The data is anonymous and they'll only be asked to input their initials (this comes in later) as an identifier.
* They fill a rather long survey for their semi-constant factors. I've figured the following out but I need help figuring more out since I want this to be as exhaustive as possible.
   * Socio-economic status:
      * Educational Background
      * Annual Income
      * Family Background
   * Habits:
      * Smoking
      * Drinking
      * Exercising
      * Drugs
   * Personal Life
      * Hobbies - Presence or not - Can be expanded
      * Community
      * Relationship satisfaction
      * Marital status
      * Self-worth - Could be a scale of 1-10
   * Anything else?
* Then, they receive a Code which would be their initials followed by a random 3-digit number. This would be secret and will be used to login for the second part.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2**

The Code will help me join Part 1 and Part 2 of Data Collection, and keep the information anonymous. Now, they will either be asked to or get a push notification (however we work out the tech side of it) to fill in how they felt on a day for 30 days.

The first thought is to have a simple slider scale with a few tappable tags that describe their mood (need help figuring these out as well)

\----------

Once all that is done, I'll move to my analysis and modelling if all of the data collection goes well. I'm hoping to target an n of 100 at least but I know it'll be difficult. Still, I'll try to make it work. I want to challenge myself on this as well.

\----------

**Here's what I need help with:**

* More factors for Part 1 of the Survey
* Tags for Part 2 of the Survey (possibly some expert who has worked with this domain before could help)
* Anything I'm missing here which could come to bite me later
* Overall opinion about this approach and/or suggestions to make it better.

Thank you so much. I'm really inching on my deadlines since I have to manage this with my full-time job (the MS is online) and another part-time one so I'm really hoping this subreddit can help me out.",t2_4cztu4xv,False,,0,False,"Help, Advice and Resources Needed for my Master's Thesis (Topic: Mood)",[],r/datascience,False,6,projects,0,False,t3_dyyvnn,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Projects,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1574265257.0,text,6,,,text,self.datascience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pursuing my Master&amp;#39;s in DS and I have to do a thesis. My proposal revolves more or less around the idea of mood. It has two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What semi-constant factors (education, financial status etc.) impact an individual&amp;#39;s mood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a general trend related to the concept of mood in general for this population or are there any significant correlations with factors found in 1?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve structured my problem-solving in such a way that it involves a month or so of data collection. I know I could&amp;#39;ve looked for datasets online but I really wanted to dive deep with this since this is my first thesis and the problem statement is close to my heart since I have mood swings and anxiety issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, I&amp;#39;m looking to solve data collection like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask people to fill an initial survey. My friend is ready to help me with the website. I have some experience too. The data is anonymous and they&amp;#39;ll only be asked to input their initials (this comes in later) as an identifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They fill a rather long survey for their semi-constant factors. I&amp;#39;ve figured the following out but I need help figuring more out since I want this to be as exhaustive as possible.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socio-economic status:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educational Background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family Background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Habits:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Life

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hobbies - Presence or not - Can be expanded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationship satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marital status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-worth - Could be a scale of 1-10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, they receive a Code which would be their initials followed by a random 3-digit number. This would be secret and will be used to login for the second part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Code will help me join Part 1 and Part 2 of Data Collection, and keep the information anonymous. Now, they will either be asked to or get a push notification (however we work out the tech side of it) to fill in how they felt on a day for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thought is to have a simple slider scale with a few tappable tags that describe their mood (need help figuring these out as well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all that is done, I&amp;#39;ll move to my analysis and modelling if all of the data collection goes well. I&amp;#39;m hoping to target an n of 100 at least but I know it&amp;#39;ll be difficult. Still, I&amp;#39;ll try to make it work. I want to challenge myself on this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I need help with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More factors for Part 1 of the Survey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags for Part 2 of the Survey (possibly some expert who has worked with this domain before could help)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything I&amp;#39;m missing here which could come to bite me later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall opinion about this approach and/or suggestions to make it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I've also read that Gower's Distance is something to consider, but that it's also just a heuristic so it should be supplemented by other metrics. What other distance metrics are there to consider that handle mixed datasets?

And what dimensionality reduction techniques have worked? I heard tSNE isn't an option for big data, so would UMAP work? Or what other techniques should I use?

————————————————————————

Hey everyone, first time posting here. I hope this is the right place to post this. 

I’m an MS statistics graduate student (with a DS concentration) graduating summer 2020. 

I am in the fortunate position of having 2 job offers and I’m having a really hard time deciding which is the smarter long term choice. I have about 2 years of experience doing statistical work as a research assistant, but this will be my first big job in this field. 

Any and all advice/experience would be really helpful! 

Option A: 

-Big Finance Company (well-known)

-Senior Analyst Position

-85k base, 97k tc

-Lead my own projects (but most of them have been more SWE than Statistical in nature)

-Dream location (but higher cost of living)

-Little to no mentoring 

-I’m the only stats person in a team of SWE

-Potential to move into leadership role since my skills are niche here

-I have to work while I finish grad school (I’m a full-time student) and there is very little flexibility for taking time for exams/school stuff

-good work/life balance 

-2 weeks paid vacation

-Horrible work/life balance while I finish school (pushing 70+ hour weeks currently and it’s affecting my health). 

-More established department (Risk MGMT), bureaucratic 

Option B: 

-Big Bank (regional but still big company)

-Data Scientist Position

-115k base, 132k tc 

-Projects decided for me, but more consulting style (variety of projects), and working in teams

-Low cost of living area (but not desirable)

-Work with other statisticians/data scientists so more opportunity for collaboration 

-Finish school, take 1 month off, THEN start 

-40-60hr weeks because there are deadlines 

-3 weeks paid vacation 

-Relocation Package

-Higher 401k contribution

-Newer department (2 years old, decision science) so may function more like start up

If it helps I’m in my mid-20’s and I’m trying to think of what decision is best long-term. 

I’ve been racking my brain on this for 2 weeks now. Option B would be much easier to pick if Option A wasn’t my dream city.

I'm aware these roles typically require a software backend background as well as a data science background. I love programming software/apps but also want to dive into the field of machine learning and computer vision, so I figured ML Engineer might be a fit for me.

I'm going to start my full-time M.S. - Comp Sci program at a top 20 ranked US school in January 2020 and hope to graduate by Dec 2020 (exactly 1-year) because the requirement is only 10 courses.

These are my 10 courses below.Does anyone think everything listed here will be sufficient to obtain a ML engineer post-grad internship/entry level role afterwards?  


**Winter Semester:**(I am required to finish these 3 ""foundation courses"" first before taking any electives.)

1.) **Foundations of Algorithms**

2.) **Foundations of Computer Architecture**

3.) **Foundations of Software Engineering**

Personal time — Java OOP projects to build portfolio, learn more python and stats, etc...  


**Summer Semester:**

1.) **Data Science** (Overview and Intro to DS topics)

2.) **Intro to Machine Learning** (More theory related and can't use libraries/tools)

3.) **Intro to Database Systems**

4.) **Large-Scale Database System**  


**Fall Semester:**

1.) **Applied Machine Learning** (Covers ML libraries/tools and apply to real-world data from Kaggle/UCI/KDD)

2.) **Big Data Processing Using Hadoop**

3.) **Information Retrieval** (Similar to Data Mining I believe)

Personal time — Do own machine learning projects/try Kaggle competitions to improve portfolio

826,,datascience,"I am 5 years into my career as a business consultant and have climbed up the ladder to manager (project lead, team lead,involved in hiring and promotion decisions, etc.).

While I generally enjoy doing strategic consulting my real passion is data analysis.

Over the last two years I have prioritized evolving from run-of-the-mill market research analysis towards using more advanced analytics. I use R &amp; Python now instead of SPSS, train ML models (Random Forest, Xgboost, etc.) instead of simply multivariate analysis and have dipped into advanced stuff like neural nets,etc.

I`d really like to switch towards a pure data science role because I like the work and want to get away from consultant work hours.

However in the end I do not have a CS background and while I understand the basics do not have time to really get familiar with stuff like SQL,non-analytics Python and possible languages to prototype apps and front-ends. From a practically stand point my current work really only focuses on analytics (based on mostly available data) as well as the strategic context (which questions to ask, what to do with the answers as well as consulting business on how to develop DS capabilities). None of the models I developed have ever been put into production for example.

I don`t think that would be a problem if I want to switch towards entry level data science but I feel with my business and management background I should aim higher (even if just to avoid a wage downgrade).

Taking this all together I do not know whether I am actually skilled and desirable enough for the senior level data science roles I covet.

What do you think?

Update:

In another post somebody summed up four key dimensions of DS skills which I really liked. So I think my profile would be something like this:
