In programming languages, is it correct that inspection is to read the state of an object or program, while reflection is to modify it?


What are the differences between inspection and reflection in SQLAlchemy? Do they have the same differences in programming languages?

In SQLAlchemy, we can Inspect - Get Database Information

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy import inspect
    db_uri = 'sqlite:///db.sqlite'
    engine = create_engine(db_uri)
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    # Get table information
    print(inspector.get_table_names())
    # Get column information
    print(inspector.get_columns('EX1')) 

and Reflection - Loading Table from Existing Database

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy import MetaData
    from sqlalchemy import Table
    db_uri = 'sqlite:///db.sqlite'
    engine = create_engine(db_uri)

I have a file containing hundreds of timestamps. The format is in days/Hrs/Mins/Secs/MicroSecs/ since January 1st 1970 (if I'm interpreting it right, which I believe I am). I need to convert this entire timestamp to microseconds resolution.  

Why the need for microseconds? I measuring interrupt signals on a PowerPC 603 processor. I need this resolution to properly graph these values with respect to time. Here is what the timestamp looks like...

###__[UPDATE]__  
Per u/hardonchairs and u/socal_nerdtastic I have pieced together something I feel is working correctly. I think it is. If someone see's something let me know. User u/Kerbart mentioned that leap seconds is not being accounted for but I'm not comparing these timestamps to any external timestamp so I think what I have will work for my use case.  

###__[CODE THAT I THINK IS WORKING]__   
Still need to parse the csv file but that shouldn't be hard. Right now the following just assumes a static value. I'm deciding to ignore the ""22673"" value since every row in my csv file has that same value. Therefore, in my conversions I'll just assume a proper string for todays date being ""2020-01-29"". Our ntp server I think is alittle off hence why it's saying 22673 (or so I'm assuming that's why). I've never messed with `datetime` before so big thanks to you fellows below.

38,,learnpython,"Good Morning,

&amp;#x200B;

Before I ask you my question, I would like to mention that I am currently teaching myself Python in my free time.

As my first project, I chose the automated operation of a web app with Selenium.

It shows that I learn about it much faster than watching hours of tutorials on YouTube.

&amp;#x200B;

a few words to explain what my program does.

I like to play a round of Fifa 20 on the PS4. Fifa 20 has a web app that you can use to buy and sell players or manage your club.

My program now searches in the web app for specific players (who were set too cheap), buys them and puts them back for sale at the current market value.

So I can generate game currency for my club while I'm at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I have set up the program so that you can either choose option 1 (#start buy only mode) or option 2 (# Start full routine).

Depending on which option was selected, one of the two while loops is activated.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking for a solution for days now, if I can install a start / stop function here. Because it is currently the case that if I want to interrupt the process in order to look at something manually in the web app, I always have to end the whole process, i.e. the chromedriver etc. and in principle the .py has to be started again.

&amp;#x200B;

I have now read that this can be covered with threading, but I have to say that I absolutely cannot get any further. Hence the hope that you may be able to help me with a solution?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't figure out how I would have to rewrite the code, that I have the possibility to stop or restart the process by typing ""start"" or ""stop"" in the console. The restart or reset should then lead to the query whether you want to use option 1 or 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Enclosed my code: [https://codeshare.io/5OpZVP](https://codeshare.io/5OpZVP)

        Adds the given letter and frequency combination as a Frequency object
        to the list. If the given letter is already in the list, the given
        frequency is added to its frequency.

        If the updated frequency is greater than the frequency of the previous
        node then it should be moved into order, ie, so that it is after
        all items with the same or greater frequency.

        If the letter is not in the list then the new frequency object should be
        added to the list so that it is after all letters
        with the same or higher frequency.

        Adding new letters with frequency 1 should be the sole usage case in
        this assignment and you can make your code more efficient if you treat
        letters with frequency of 1 as a special case. But, your code should
        still deal with the more general case, eg, my_list.add(&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, 4)

So a little background on the project. I am working on a dataset with a lot of different georeferenced images. Each line contains two coordinates and two images. What I tried to do is take a few cities for the sake of checking the data and finding the corresponding coordinates. To do this I used a nested dictionary.

However now I have numerous records left which do not fit the criteria but I'm having trouble deleting these as I do not know how to write it down. I hope the pastebin and this explanation makes clear what I want to do. I want to simply completely wipe each record that does not contain a city. Therefore it has to check the nested dictionary for the City value and then remove the dictionary in front of it

&lt;p&gt;So a little background on the project. I am working on a dataset with a lot of different georeferenced images. Each line contains two coordinates and two images. What I tried to do is take a few cities for the sake of checking the data and finding the corresponding coordinates. To do this I used a nested dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However now I have numerous records left which do not fit the criteria but I&amp;#39;m having trouble deleting these as I do not know how to write it down. I hope the pastebin and this explanation makes clear what I want to do. I want to simply completely wipe each record that does not contain a city. Therefore it has to check the nested dictionary for the City value and then remove the dictionary in front of it&lt;/p&gt;

What I need to do is convert it to a dictionary.

I've searched the subreddit and rest of the internet for a while for an answer to this. Apologies if I have missed it.

Problem is at the very end of chaper 5 of automate the boring stuff:

 

#### List to Dictionary Function for Fantasy Game Inventory

Imagine that a vanquished dragon’s loot is represented as a list of strings like this:

dragonLoot = \['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby'\]

Write a function named addToInventory(inventory, addedItems), where the inventory parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory (like in the previous project) and the addedItems parameter is a list like dragonLoot. The addToInventory() function should return a dictionary that represents the updated inventory.

I managed to code a function that updates an inventory dictionary with a list of loot. I was really pleased with myself until I tried to add to the code to repeat the function on a further list of loot. What I found then was that the function added the new list of loot to the original dictionary (pre-addition of the first list).

**Code is here:**

 [https://github.com/Envir0nmental0range/EnvOrange/tree/InventoryAdder](https://github.com/Envir0nmental0range/EnvOrange/tree/InventoryAdder) 

**Output is here:**

\&gt;&gt;&gt; %Run 'add to inventory multiple [times2.py](https://times2.py)'

Initial player inventory: 

{'gold coin': 42, 'rope': 1}

Loot from Dragon: 

\['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby'\]

The updated inventory is: 

{'gold coin': 3, 'rope': 1, 'dagger': 1, 'ruby': 1}

Loot from witch: 

\['gold coin', 'gold coin', 'witch hat'\]

The updated inventory is: 

{'gold coin': 2, 'rope': 1, 'witch hat': 1}

Loot from ogre: 

\['club', 'rope'\]

The updated inventory is: 

{'gold coin': 47, 'rope': 1, 'club': 1}

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------

I  have run the code with the function substituted with the below:

\#define function

def addToInventory(inventory, loot):

inventory = (Counter(inventory) + Counter(loot))

print(""Updated inventory is:"")

print(inventory)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This gives the same output as my linked code.

I've also added the line ""return inventory"" as the last line of the block of my addToInventory function, this hasn't helped.

I'm pretty confident that the problem is that my function just calls up the inventory at the start of the code but can't find an explanation or remedy.

My question is this. This function is working as intended but I don't *really* understand why. I only return the card value, not the remaining deck. Why does the deck value also 'save' for lack of a better term. For example this function is called within the context of a larger function and even though I am not returning it, the deck will get smaller and smaller as cards are picked from it.

Example of a project that had me stumped:

Comma Code
Say you have a list value like this:

spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']

Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it. Be sure to test the case where an empty list [] is passed to your function...

I end up spending hours trying to wrap my head around how to go about writing the code to solve this project, and eventually get sleepy...

I've discovered that if I look up the answers to the projects, copy and paste the code into the IDE I'm using, run the code, and then analyze it to see how it works, it sort of helps me understand?  

Just wanted to hear opinions on this, it's working for me right now while the act of writing code is still intimidating and makes me feel like a dum-dum for not being able to conceive how to put together basic things like this.

111,,learnpython,"Hi,

I have done a bit of python and a decent bit of c programming while becoming a hardware engineer but its usually hacked together to get my electronics project working with the logic I want.

Now I'm doing a project that needs to store information into some form of log or database. I'm hoping you can point me in the direction of the easiest/quickest way to get an MVP up and running.

The project is running on a raspberry pi, it reads a UID from an RFID tag. What I want to do is:

When a new tag is scanned, the UID is logged with a timestamp, a notification is sent to a mobile phone, asking if this UID should be whitelisted or blacklisted.

If whitelisted, when next scanned it will allow access and no notification will be sent. But a timestamp log of this will be saved

If blacklisted when next scanned it will alert the user (mobile phone). Also logging a timestamp.

I think for the phone integration the easiest way to do this would be to utilise a chat bot like telegram?

Then for saving all this info, should I use a csv/json file? or should I use something like SQLite with the bot?

I would like to be able to request the full log from the chatbot, or eventually request logs for specific UIDs.

How would I saved these records? and individual one for each UID and timestamp, or group the UID and all it's individual timestamps in a record?

If you can explain this in terms that I can go and research, or give me any pointers it would be greatly appreciated.

Help Wanted

I have just started coding and know pretty much nothing. I am looking to make a piece of code that infinitely does a simple calculation. I don’t really know how to explain what I want to do so please bear with me. :)

So there is two numbers.
Example:
100 300
 
And you have to make a new set of numbers.
Example:
100 300,
200 400,

To make the first number of the second pair of numbers you minus the first number from the second number in the first pair. 

Example:
100 300,

300-100= 200

100 300,
200 ......,


To make the second number in the second pair of numbers you add both the numbers from the first pair pair.

Example:
100 300,

100+300=400

100 300,
200 400,

The ideal code would keep doing this calculation and make a long list of pairs. 

I know I am asking a lot but if you do know how to do this please explain it to me.

And also thank you if you have actually read all this.

This is what I have so far:

\- A main script called ""main.py"" that starts a subprocess of Maya, and executes another script called ""mayaProc.py"" inside this Maya subprocess.

\- A script called ""mayaProc.py"" that does some 3D modeling work inside Maya.

My problem is that I have a very large dictionary that I get from a database using a function inside the ""main.py"" script, and I need to somehow pass this dictionary to the ""mayaProc.py"" script. I know I can pass arguments to a subprocess, however I get an error saying that my argument is too long (as it is a very long dictionary).

What would be the best approach to solve this problem?

My code for starting the subprocess inside ""main.py"" currently looks like this:

    MAYA_PATH = ""path to my Maya executable""
    SCRIPT_PATH = ""path to the mayaProc.py script that I want to run inside Maya""

Hi coders!

- I am a finance professional with academic background in accounting, tax and finance. I have a rich work experience in taxation laws and tax accounting. 
- Zero programming background. But I love making templates in excel that automate tiny bits of work here and there. (I know what algorithms are and have seen workflows of P2P, O2C cycles). 

I was always fascinated by the way an ERP system works and wondered what happens inside the system (read I love automation). 

Currently, I am working on a project where I am supporting the IT team with ERP implementation. I have seen words like architecture, schema, query, back end, inquiry, landscape, interface, etc. being thrown around by the IT guys and thought these guys are really cool (because I don't understand what they are talking about).

Anyway, after working with the IT team I realized that these guys know how to code but have a hard time understanding the logic and process of accounting / taxation. I am not talking about the tax law, I am just referring to the process of how these things work.

I don't want to be hard on the IT guys because I know they are good at what they do (coding) and probably are not too familiar with the domain (accounting and taxes), but it got me thinking about what if.. 



My thoughts;
1. Considering the fact that there is huge potential for automation in the accounting, taxation and investment industry, if I learn how to code, can I capitalize on my domain knowledge?

2. If yes how long would it take to achieve decent WORKING knowledge (I am more interested in the practical application part rather than a degree/ certification) - say developing an app or automating part of the work or making an online tool that calculates taxes, etc.?

3. I'm also intrigued by how apps work (android) and want to try out an idea - fairly simple idea nothing fancy - say calculating taxe based on x number of inputs by the user. Is this possible to achieve in 6 months?

&lt;li&gt;Zero programming background. But I love making templates in excel that automate tiny bits of work here and there. (I know what algorithms are and have seen workflows of P2P, O2C cycles). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always fascinated by the way an ERP system works and wondered what happens inside the system (read I love automation). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am working on a project where I am supporting the IT team with ERP implementation. I have seen words like architecture, schema, query, back end, inquiry, landscape, interface, etc. being thrown around by the IT guys and thought these guys are really cool (because I don&amp;#39;t understand what they are talking about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after working with the IT team I realized that these guys know how to code but have a hard time understanding the logic and process of accounting / taxation. I am not talking about the tax law, I am just referring to the process of how these things work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be hard on the IT guys because I know they are good at what they do (coding) and probably are not too familiar with the domain (accounting and taxes), but it got me thinking about what if.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts;
1. Considering the fact that there is huge potential for automation in the accounting, taxation and investment industry, if I learn how to code, can I capitalize on my domain knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If yes how long would it take to achieve decent WORKING knowledge (I am more interested in the practical application part rather than a degree/ certification) - say developing an app or automating part of the work or making an online tool that calculates taxes, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also intrigued by how apps work (android) and want to try out an idea - fairly simple idea nothing fancy - say calculating taxe based on x number of inputs by the user. Is this possible to achieve in 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I am planning on taking a career break and intend to learn all of this in the time I&amp;#39;ll have. I can invest 5-6 hours daily.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to create three dropdown widget in python. The first with the list of servers :

    import os
    
    Servers_list = os.listdir(""/xxx/xxx/xxx/Servers/"")
    
    test = widgets.Dropdown(options = (Servers_list))
    display(test)

The second with the list of directory in the server selected in the first dropdown and the last with the list of ths csv in the directory selected in the previous dropdown. 

But I don't know how to create a link between each dropdown. I'm able to create a dropdown for each servers and each directory in each servers, like that :


    import os
    
    
    Date = os.listdir(""/home/tim/Bureau/Servers/Server1/"")
    Date1 = widgets.Dropdown(options = (Date))

    Date3 = os.listdir(""/home/tim/Bureau/Servers/Server2/"")
    Date4 = widgets.Dropdown(options = (Date3))
    display(Date4)
    [ ... ]


But in my example, I've only few directory. In the reality, I've 100 directory to manage...

The idea is when I choose my server in the first dropdown, the list of the directorys in this server will be in the second dropdown. Then, when I choose my directory in the second dropdown, I can choose the csv wanted to display it.

I'm able to create each dropdown independently of the others, but I don't know how to create link between us...

and I have tried to import it with the following commands:

    a=np.genfromtxt(""decay_data.txt"", delimiter="","", skip_header=1, dtype=(int, int, str, int, int, int, int, float, int, float, int, float, int, float, int, float, int, float))

Which results in the correct result except for my array being 1D and filled with tuples and the string column being empty

Example:

    array([(   1,   10010, '',   1,   0,   1, 0, 0.00000e+00,    0, 0., 0, 0., 0, 0., 0, 0., 0, 0.),

This gives me a 2D array but now all my numbers are strings as well (which makes sense since I called them unicode)

    a=np.genfromtxt(""decay_data.txt"", delimiter="","", skip_header=1)

This gives a nice 2D array as well but my string column is now filled with NaN.

Worst case I could use the second option and just convert back every time I need the data to be an integer but that would be ductape coding and I would prefer avoiding that.

What I am trying to do is plot three columns on the same plot, `Receny_Norm , Frequency_Norm , Monetary_Norm` for each `Persona` type. I have 8 persona types in my full dataset. 

I can plot them one after the other:

    for persona in df['Persona'].unique():

I thought about ways to do this and am currently learning about threads. I figured out two methods and I'm not sure what is the best one of them (or if they both have flaws).

The first example has a time.sleep in each thread that determines how long it waits until it reads a value and puts it into a deque for the main app to read (this is a simplified example with no acutal connectivity) and then waits again. The main app also loops indefinitely and prints a value whenever there is one in the deque.

    import threading
    import time
    from collections import deque
    from random import randint
    
    class App:
        def __init__(self):

I am trying to learn web-scraping using BeautifulSoup. My mini-project plan for learning is to scrape reviews from TrustPilot based on 2 companies, 1 with a good score and 1 with a bad score then perform some data visualisation such as wordwalls etc, then if all goes well some NLP.

I started last night with my aim just to scrape the first page of reviews and then build from there.

    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import requests

""UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\U0001f624' in position 300: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;""

I've written a simple GUI program in Python 3. It has three buttons, the first two work, but the third does not.

The third button is supposed to close the window (same as the 'X' button in the title bar).

I suspect part of my problem is that I have to use a non-standard Python module (breezypythongui), so a lot of the solutions I've seen so far don't work for me, because they all refer to tkinter methods. However, the breezypythongui module imports tkinter itself, and a lot of its own methods are based on tkinter.

Also, my program is written as a class with a main method, so my mainloop is in the main method. A simplified version of my code is [https://pastebin.com/EBevWwcr](https://pastebin.com/EBevWwcr).

Having read across several sites, I've tried adopting what I read to my situation. It seems to ""end"" the program, based on what I see in Python's Shell, and the window's contents clear, but the window doesn't actually close, until I click the 'X' button.

I've been able to get all of the relevant information I am looking for such as artist name, date of show, venue, city, but I'm really having trouble with my final output. I am looking to sort all of the shows in my DataFrame by City and then Date so the output should look like this:

I think in my code right now the outputs are just based in order of the requests.get artist\_id iterations, but I'd like it to somehow get all of the requests together and then sort it as one DataFrame at the very end. I have my data I'm pulling for output in a variable that is a dictionary with keys for each of the elements I'm interested in such as date, artist\_id, name of artist, metroArea, city, and venue. 

Here is some of my code:

    artist_ids = [

                    ('Artist3', '4550768'), ('Artist4', '5311933')
                ]
    
    
    
    for artist_id in artist_ids:
        r = requests.get('https://api.songkick.com/api/3.0/artists/' + artist_id[1] + '/calendar.json', params=params)
        response = r.json()
        shows = response['resultsPage']['results']
        
        for show in shows:
            try:
                shows = shows['event']
    
                formatted_shows = [{

                        new_show_name = artist_id[0]
                        new_date = sub['date']
                        new_date_time = new_date = datetime.strptime(new_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
                        date_time_fin = new_date_time.strftime('%b - %-d').upper()
                        formatted_show_final = [date_time_fin, new_show_name, sub['venue'], sub['city'], new_metro_area]
                         df = pd.DataFrame([formatted_show_final], columns=['Date', 'Artist', 'Venue', 'City', 'Metro_Area'])
                        df.sort_values(by=['Metro_Area', 'Date'])
            except KeyError:
                pass

If I were to put an empty array before the first for artist\_id statement and then append the formatted\_show\_final variable to it and create the DataFrame based on that appended array, I get a valueerror that has to do with the shape saying the passed data had 1 column not 5. I am really struggling to figure out a better approach to my current in either how to pull the data in individual variables as opposed to the single variable dictionary I've went with as I think that would solve the entire issue.

&amp;#39;FEB - 8&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist1&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Nashville, TN&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;11104&amp;#39;

&amp;#39;FEB - 9&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;New York, NY&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;7644&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;FEB - 10&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Nashville, TN&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;11104&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;FEB - 1&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist3&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Nashville, TN&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;11104&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;FEB - 6&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist3&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Los Angeles, CA&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;17835&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;FEB - 15&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist3&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;New York, NY&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;7644&amp;#39;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in my code right now the outputs are just based in order of the requests.get artist_id iterations, but I&amp;#39;d like it to somehow get all of the requests together and then sort it as one DataFrame at the very end. I have my data I&amp;#39;m pulling for output in a variable that is a dictionary with keys for each of the elements I&amp;#39;m interested in such as date, artist_id, name of artist, metroArea, city, and venue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some of my code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;metro_areas = [
                (&amp;#39;Los Angeles&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;17835&amp;#39;),
                (&amp;#39;New York City&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;7644&amp;#39;),
                (&amp;#39;Nashville&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;11104&amp;#39;)
            ]

artist_ids = [
                (&amp;#39;Artist1&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;8668659&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;Artist2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;7688239&amp;#39;), 
                (&amp;#39;Artist3&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;4550768&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;Artist4&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;5311933&amp;#39;)
            ]



for artist_id in artist_ids:
    r = requests.get(&amp;#39;https://api.songkick.com/api/3.0/artists/&amp;#39; + artist_id[1] + &amp;#39;/calendar.json&amp;#39;, params=params)
    response = r.json()
    shows = response[&amp;#39;resultsPage&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;results&amp;#39;]

    for show in shows:
        try:
            shows = shows[&amp;#39;event&amp;#39;]

            formatted_shows = [{

                }
                for s in shows if len(s[&amp;#39;performance&amp;#39;]) &amp;gt; 0

                if new_metro_area in [area[1] for area in metro_areas]:
                    new_show = artist_id[1]
                    new_show_name = artist_id[0]
                    new_date = sub[&amp;#39;date&amp;#39;]
                    new_date_time = new_date = datetime.strptime(new_date, &amp;#39;%Y-%m-%d&amp;#39;)
                    date_time_fin = new_date_time.strftime(&amp;#39;%b - %-d&amp;#39;).upper()
                    formatted_show_final = [date_time_fin, new_show_name, sub[&amp;#39;venue&amp;#39;], sub[&amp;#39;city&amp;#39;], new_metro_area]
                     df = pd.DataFrame([formatted_show_final], columns=[&amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Artist&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Venue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;City&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Metro_Area&amp;#39;])
                    df.sort_values(by=[&amp;#39;Metro_Area&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;])
        except KeyError:
            pass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to put an empty array before the first for artist_id statement and then append the formatted_show_final variable to it and create the DataFrame based on that appended array, I get a valueerror that has to do with the shape saying the passed data had 1 column not 5. I am really struggling to figure out a better approach to my current in either how to pull the data in individual variables as opposed to the single variable dictionary I&amp;#39;ve went with as I think that would solve the entire issue. If anyone has any suggestions or other approaches to what I am looking to accomplish that would be extremely appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

200,,learnpython," Hey everyone, what I'm trying to do is Detect when my screensaver comes on, due to inactivity.

You  know when you don't use it for a while, and the screen goes black? That  is what I am trying to detect. I'd like to write a python script for  this, but if it has to be a different type of script that is also fine.

I am running the latest Raspbian Buster on a brand new Raspberry Pi 4 :)

In  this project I am able to control power remotely to my Monitor using a  couple of python scripts and a 5v relay, scripts shown here:

`import RPi.GPIO as GPIO`

`import time`

`GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)`

`relay = 11`

`GPIO.setup(relay, GPIO.OUT)`

`def monitor_on(pin):`

`GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.HIGH)`

`try:`

`monitor_on(relay)`

`print(""Monitor ON"")`

`time.sleep(10)`

`except KeyboardInterrupt:`

`print(""Cleaning up!"")`

`GPIO.cleanup()`

I also have another script that will turn the monitor off.

I have the relay signal connected to pin 11 of the pi (*thats GPIO 17 if you use GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)* )

and power to 5v and ground to ground.

Now,  if I could add a way to detect when my screensaver turns on (meaning  when the pi turns the screen black) and call the ""Monitor off"" script,  that would be so awesome.

I am dealing with bit of a problem, since if a list is given as input that contains numbers higher than 25, the function will not convert them as letters but rather strange characters such as ""/, ) &amp; "" and such.

So, if you make over 10k in profit, you get 3% of total profit, plus if you sold six ""EPS'"" you add a percent to that total.

The idea behind this tool is sales reps can input that data and it will calculate their commission payout.

done buttons but I think I understand how) However, I'm stuck on what to do to use the user input data in my formulas. Any advice? Code below:

&lt;p&gt;So, if you make over 10k in profit, you get 3% of total profit, plus if you sold six &amp;quot;EPS&amp;#39;&amp;quot; you add a percent to that total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this tool is sales reps can input that data and it will calculate their commission payout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first project I&amp;#39;ve ever built, and I managed to create MOST of the GUI part (still havent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;done buttons but I think I understand how) However, I&amp;#39;m stuck on what to do to use the user input data in my formulas. Any advice? Code below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note: All of the stuff under &amp;#39;def&amp;#39; like &amp;quot;Gross Profit&amp;quot; are just place holders so it makes sense to look at for me while I learn how to tie it together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Tried input syntax, my GUI no longer appears, it just shows the question in the console now. Im totally lost on what to even look up to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;

And in which field i can go after learning Python? And how much time is required to learn these things and for getting job? Now I have winter vacations and mostly everyday I learn 6 to 7 hours and during my university i can give 3 or 4 hours, I still have two years in graduation and in two years i want to learn enough that i can able to earn money. I do not want to dependent anymore on my parents, Any guidelines, Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

I made 2-4 player Uno (vs computer, because if it was multi-player, you'd be able to see each others cards, which is besides the point). I've optimised it as well as I possibly can. Though, I could probably replace some of the functions with just code, but I prefer the readability and non-global internal variables that function brings.

On line 162 in the updateHand function of the player object,  I'm having a bit of trouble with the maths/logic.  Due to the fact that if self.side is not equal to ""H"" (which is horizontal), the screen's length on the side (vertical) is smaller (than horizontal),  I'm trying to have the card frames overlap slightly, however, in doing so, the bottom half of the last card is cut off. The attempts I've tried to remedy this have all fixed this, but introduced the issue that the first card has been completely pushed outside of the label (which is what's current happening in the code in github).

I thought about giving the last card a separate frame to parent it to and having that positioned to overlap the area where the card would be (which would require trial &amp; error maths to get the precise positions, at least, for me).

&lt;p&gt;On line 162 in the updateHand function of the player object,  I&amp;#39;m having a bit of trouble with the maths/logic.  Due to the fact that if self.side is not equal to &amp;quot;H&amp;quot; (which is horizontal), the screen&amp;#39;s length on the side (vertical) is smaller (than horizontal),  I&amp;#39;m trying to have the card frames overlap slightly, however, in doing so, the bottom half of the last card is cut off. The attempts I&amp;#39;ve tried to remedy this have all fixed this, but introduced the issue that the first card has been completely pushed outside of the label (which is what&amp;#39;s current happening in the code in github).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about giving the last card a separate frame to parent it to and having that positioned to overlap the area where the card would be (which would require trial &amp;amp; error maths to get the precise positions, at least, for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have a better way to go about this?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Reddit! I am a third year CS/Math student and for the last couple months I have been learning the basics of web dev and making my first website. 

I had the idea to make this website a couple years ago, I wanted to test my skills at predicting the results of NBA games, so I manually input my predictions into a spreadsheet every day and checked the results the following morning. This became tiring fast, so I stopped doing it, but then I decided to go ahead and automate the whole process. I learned a lot about everything web-related in the process: I didn't know much about HTTP, Javascript, the client-server paradigm or deploying an application before this. Overall a great experience, although it had some frustrating moments, of course :)

A few comments:
* To avoid creating an account if you don't want to, you can use the username ""guest2"" and the password ""guest"". However, if someone else has made the daily bets using that account, you won't be able to make more of them.
* I ask for your email during registration, but only for the purposes of recovering the password. In fact, you can write anything in that field as long as it matches the structure of an email, so just write a fake one if you're uncomfortable with it.
* The backend is written entirely in Python (Flask) and the frontend is mainly VueJS. 
* The game odds are pulled from an API, and the scores and team records are scrapped from a major sports media website.

What I'm looking for:
* Feedback on the user interface and experience.

This included trying to make the code actually readable, and with good documentation. Additionally, I actually put some time into what I think is a decent [README.md](https://README.md) on GitHub.

Another challenge that I found was trying to reduce the required amount of user input down to as little as possible. In the early stages, there were things that I created outside of the script and fed into it. But, I realized that those could be automated and put into the script, so I found a place for them. Another challenge was creating class methods that could stand on their own if called by the user, but were also integrated, so that each method would be invoked to solve the entire structure just by the user calling the solve() method.

These are two of the tables: EDITED

    class Upc(Base):

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

        upc = relationship(""Upc"", back_populates='asin')

The code that inserts new data:

            """"""Save asins in the database.
    
             This method is called for every item pipeline component.

            session = self.Session()
            asin = Asin()
            upc = Upc()
    
            asin.datetime_scraped = item[""datetime_scraped""]
            asin.upc = item[""upc""]
            # upc.upc = item[""upc""] # this didn't work 
            asin.asin = item[""asin""]
            asin.prod_title = item[""prod_title""]
            asin.listing_price = item[""listing_price""]

            finally:
                session.close()

I think I'm missing something basic about how to setup these relationships, but so far my googling has been unproductive.

Solution: In case someone stumbles across this and wants to save themself half a day, this is what the final, successful, version of process\_item looks like for me:

&lt;p&gt;The code that inserts new data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    def process_item(self, item, spider):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Save asins in the database.

         This method is called for every item pipeline component.
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        session = self.Session()
        asin = Asin()
        upc = Upc()

        asin.datetime_scraped = item[&amp;quot;datetime_scraped&amp;quot;]
        asin.upc = item[&amp;quot;upc&amp;quot;]
        # upc.upc = item[&amp;quot;upc&amp;quot;] # this didn&amp;#39;t work

        finally:
            session.close()

        return item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;m missing something basic about how to setup these relationships, but so far my googling has been unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: In case someone stumbles across this and wants to save themself half a day, this is what the final, successful, version of process_item looks like for me: &lt;/p&gt;

I created script that helps me sort and rename monthly reports. To start the reports are first housed in subfolders, broken out by asset. Example below:

    Asset 1
        Operating Statement
        CF Statement
    Asset 2
        Operating Statement
        CF Statement

The script parses the asset subfolders, copying the files and sorting them into subfolders based on filename. Example of new subfolder breakout:

    Consolidated Reporting Folder
        Operating Statement Subfolder
        CF Statement Subfolder

The code is successfully renaming and copying the files, but I've having issues with an else statement I added in. My goal with the else statement, is that it kicks off an error message whenever a corresponding subfolder isn't found for a given file. Right now the error message kicks up for every file, even when there's no issue. Below is my code.

    import os, shutil

    Asset_ID = {'Asset 1' : 'ID 1', 'Asset 2' : 'ID 2', 'Asset 3' : 'ID 3'}

    path_folder = os.path.join('L:\\Property 1\\Financial Reporting', date)
    destination = os.path.join(path_folder, 'zConsolidated')
    destination_subfolders = os.listdir(destination)

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path_folder):

Once I reboot the python console it works fine again for the next use, only to require a reboot with every run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like a problem that could be solved by closing the serial port when the code finishes, so I am running serial.Serial.close(), but I get the error &amp;quot;close() missing 1 required positional argument: &amp;#39;self&amp;#39; and can&amp;#39;t seem to find much online help with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import serial,time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a=&amp;quot;Beep Boop&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;arduino=serial.Serial(&amp;#39;COM10&amp;#39;, 9600, timeout=0.1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;time.sleep(2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;arduino.write(a.encode())&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;time.sleep(2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;serial.Serial.close() #This is the line causing the afformentioned error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!!&lt;/p&gt;

279,,learnpython,"I am currently developing an Ecommerce website and decided to try flask. I am more familiar with java but have some experience writing simpler scripts with python. However i have newer created a full application with python.

When using python for a larger project i have gotten a bit confused. If i would create the same application with java i would use objects within the program and then serialize/deserialize them when using databases and cookies etc. But this is not as straightforward with python. For example there is no simple library to use when you serialize/deserialize objects to use with a mongo database.

This makes me believe that this is not the pythonic way to do things. I could ofcourse write my own code for serialization/deserialization to dicts and other formats. But this seems to complicated since the objects is large and nested. It would be easier to just pass around dicts within the program then writing complicated serialization/deserialization logic but this also seems wrong.

So therefore i ask you experienced pythonistas out there - What is it that i am not getting about python and serialization/deserialization?

Please note that i am not asking which library to use to convert python objects to mongo documents. I am asking for what i have not understod about python since the support for this type of serialization/deserialization is so limited.

**EDIT: The reason for me developing this site instead of using woo commerce/opencart its that the product pricing is very complex. The products have a price based on quantity. Each product also have lots of options and each options additional price also depends on the quantity of products you buy. This is site will not be selling plain products with a name, price and description.**

**But the real problem is that the quantities that determines the price is different for each product some products have 3 price tiers some have 4 price tiers etc. Because of this i use a mongo db instead of an relational db. This also prevents me from using ORMs like Django ORM.**

**In java i would have objects that is 2 levels nested, Product objects have product options objects. The products options would then have array lists with the prices for each qty, so technically the objects is 3 levels nested.** 

**In java i could just use Jackson to create JSON from nested objects and nested objects from JSON and the objects can be nested. I just have to specify the class i want to use and with one line of code i have a JSON from an Object or an Object form JSON. For mongo i just use mongojack.**

I am trying to aggregate some strings using group by in pandas. input data is as follows:

|Store Number|Customer Number|Order Number|Items Ordered|

|Store 01|12345|100|Chocolate|

|:-|:-|:-|:-|

I am struggling using the following code:

    df = df.groupby(['Store Number','Order Number'], as_index=False)['Items Ordered'].apply(lambda x: ' , '.join(x.astype(str))).reset_index()

Whenever this outputs I have lost the customer number column and other columns. Only the columns specified in the groupby statement remain even if I pass as\_index=False or use reset\_index() as above.

As different stores may have the same 'Order number' I need to also use the 'Store Number' in the groupby to avoid grouping 'Items Ordered'

&gt;  
&gt;red is 10300934804977441

So the word ""red"" should not be in the result. the result should be a number (it is a number in the file).

Somewhere along the way the number was interpreted as the value ""red"". I probably don't need the first value, but it would be faster to continue my file from that instead of the result number.

So perhaps someone could explain why the change is happening and how to get the number instead.

EDIT: 

The answer is that I was not at the beginning of the string. Simply backtracking to the next '\\n' fixed it. 

EDIT 2:

I also figured out how to pick up my place in the file by simply feeding different byte sizes into .seek() until my results started to sync up. 

So I read a little over 1Gb from ""numbers.txt"" that translated into 4Gb at ""numbers\_frequency.txt""; Retrieving the final value in numbers\_frequency.txt"" gave me something to check ""numbers.txt"" against and then I could easily start plugging that data in and checking where that put me.

Context: trying to start/stop a stepper by holding down a button/release

   * [thread 2](https://github.com/repitanse-porfavor/picam-ocr-receipt-reader/blob/master/pi-code/motion/drive_stepper.py#L152)(method) - stepper listener, can't stop for loop

class properties are used to communicate between threads

base of main I instantiate it, call the thread methods which start the threads.

They're running, listening(for buttons). That part works fine the ""is button pushed down"".

When I send the command to run the stepper(it takes an argument of steps) the steps are used in a for loop and there are eight steps per iteration.  I can't seem to break out of this loop.

For the stepper code the class property doesn't seem to change until the loop is done.

It is probably easier to just see the code(linked above).

I'm aware this code is super ugly(eg. use arrays/loops vs. repeated step code, etc...) I'm just trying to get something working.

Thanks for any help, it may be simple but I'm not seeing it currently(hence scattered prints)

**edit:** oh wait... maybe I figured it out? have to re-get the [stopStepper](https://github.com/repitanse-porfavor/picam-ocr-receipt-reader/blob/master/pi-code/motion/drive_stepper.py#L106) variable inside the loop vs. outside of it? Although that doesn't seem right, it's a reference to a class property that should instantly change when the button listener updates it(I let go of button). That concept does work for the button it seems.

Also I am vaguely aware of the `start()` vs. `join()` thing eg. I've been manually killing threads until I put in the conditional stops(like inside while true or class kills child threads).

**edit:** there is something wrong with `time.sleep`... I don't know why the non loop implementation seems to work correctly(what drives the stepper) the delays in the while loop seem to be ignored. I [read something](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=175287) about the implementation being different in windows vs. linux but I still think I should be able to sleep by seconds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; oh wait... maybe I figured it out? have to re-get the &lt;a href=""https://github.com/repitanse-porfavor/picam-ocr-receipt-reader/blob/master/pi-code/motion/drive_stepper.py#L106""&gt;stopStepper&lt;/a&gt; variable inside the loop vs. outside of it? Although that doesn&amp;#39;t seem right, it&amp;#39;s a reference to a class property that should instantly change when the button listener updates it(I let go of button). That concept does work for the button it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I am vaguely aware of the &lt;code&gt;start()&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; thing eg. I&amp;#39;ve been manually killing threads until I put in the conditional stops(like inside while true or class kills child threads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; there is something wrong with &lt;code&gt;time.sleep&lt;/code&gt;... I don&amp;#39;t know why the non loop implementation seems to work correctly(what drives the stepper) the delays in the while loop seem to be ignored. I &lt;a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=175287""&gt;read something&lt;/a&gt; about the implementation being different in windows vs. linux but I still think I should be able to sleep by seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;solved&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to move class property being referenced inside of for loop which seems weird... but that&amp;#39;s what fixed it. On the side my sleep indents weren&amp;#39;t correct.&lt;/p&gt;

I've decided that this is the year where I actually sit down and write out my coding ideas that I've been creating in my head, and using them as a means to learn Python.

I have a pseudocode for my first project, as it's been something I've wanted to resolve for years.

1. Find the current OS
2. Validate which OS is being used and change the working directory to the Camera Roll folder, which will be the folder where all new photos will be saved before being renamed and moved
3. For each file in the Camera Roll folder, check the file extension, then rename the file with the corresponding date and time taken exif field
4. Validate that a directory exists for the year of the exif field, and if it doesn't exist, create it
5. Move the file to the corresponding year directory

I've taken the bones of what he's shown in his videos (so far up  to video 9 where he starts to talk about pagination), and tried expanding  slightly on it to fit the needs of the app I'm working on (basic inventory  management). So, it's  Flask, WTForms, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy mostly.

It's been working pretty well, but I just discovered that *when  I add a part to my Part table, the SelectField (wtforms) on the add inventory page that allows you to choose a part doesn't actually update  to reflect any newly added parts until the web application is restarted*.  I'm wondering if that's because the query that populates the  SelectField is only run when the app starts, or the way SelectFields work, or if it's because of maybe  a flag I'm setting incorrectly or forgetting to set in my database  models. It seems like the queries run whenever the routes are triggered, because I have another page that lists all parts, and that updates whenever I add a new part using basically the same query, though it's just text as opposed to an option in a SelectField. I've tried looking up the issue and while I think I've found a few people with the same or a similar issue, I haven't found a solution that works for me yet.

Here's the Part and Inventory tables from models.py:

    class Part(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        partnum = db.Column(db.String(10), unique=True, nullable=False)
        date_added = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)
        desc = db.Column(db.String(150), nullable=False)
        type = db.Column(db.String(16), nullable=False)
        price = db.Column(db.Float(precision=2), nullable=False, default=0.00)
        serialformat = db.Column(db.String(100))
        built = db.relationship('Inventory', backref='part', lazy=True)
        sold = db.relationship('InventoryAllocation', backref='part', lazy=True)
    
        def __repr__(self):
            return f""Part('{self.partnum}', '{self.desc}', '{self.type}', '{self.price}')""
    
    
    class Inventory(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        partid = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('part.id'), nullable=False)
        date_added = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)
        serialno = db.Column(db.String(16), unique=True, nullable=False)
        invall = db.relationship('InventoryAllocation', backref='inv', lazy=True)
    
        def __repr__(self):
            return f""InventoryItem('{self.partid}', '{self.date_added}', '{self.serialno}')""

Here's addinventory from routes.py, which I thought would give a current  list of all parts (allparts) each time the route is invoked, and pass  it (parts=allparts) to the addinventory.html page to use in its  SelectField, but if I add new parts to the Part table, they don't appear in this drop-down until I restart the web app: 

    @app.route(""/addinventory"", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    @login_required
    def addinventory():
        form = AddInventory()
        allparts = Part.query.all()
        if form.validate_on_submit():
            item = Part.query.filter_by(partnum=form.partnum.data).first()
            inv = Inventory(partid=item.id, serialno=form.serial.data)
            db.session.add(inv)
            db.session.commit()
            flash('Inventory added!', 'success')
            return redirect(url_for('inventory'))
        return render_template('addinventory.html', form=form, legend='Add Inventory', parts=allparts)

I can provide more details if needed, but didn't want to overwhelm with  the whole damn codebase, so I'm taking my best stab at the source of the  issue.

I tried doing something like this which only worked correctly but only once.

    for s in venue_data:
        for i in genre_item:
            s.update(i)

It managed to place the last item of the *genre\_item* into the *venue\_data* but nothing else, I'm not sure why this is happening. How can I make sure all three items go into *venue\_data?*

Hi guys, any help would be greatly appreciate :)

A  permutation can be specified by an array P, where P\[i\] represents  the  location of the element at i in the permutation. For example, \[2, 1,  0\]  represents the permutation where elements at the index 0 and 2 are   swapped.

Given an array and a  permutation, write a function that applies the  permutation to the  array. For example, given the array \[""a"", ""b"", ""c""\]  and the permutation  \[2, 1, 0\], return \[""c"", ""b"", ""a""\].",t2_mrern4w,False,,0,False,Permutation,[],r/learnpython,False,6,,0,False,t3_euznkn,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580210122.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnpython,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, any help would be greatly appreciate :)&lt;/p&gt;

\['x', (9, 1)\]

It would be 10 'x's. You would look back 1 position (because the 1st thing in the tuple is ""1"") and then repeat that character 9 more times, giving you 10 characters. So, basically, if your second number in the tuple takes you past the end of the compressed string, this describes what you should do. 

I have these strings I need to decode from a DEFLATE format and after a day and a half, I'm stumped. Say I've got this list that used to be a string but now it's shorthanded. It now looks like :

\['a', ' ', (2, 1), 'b', ' ', (5, 4), 'c', ' ', (11, 10), 'd', ' ', (23, 22), 'e'\]  (or a shorter one, \['a', (20, 1)\])

The first encoded string should be returned as  ""a ab a abc a ab a abcd a ab a abc a ab a abcde"" and the third one needs to be returned as  ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."" Upon looking at the first one, I thought it was just string multiplication but was proven wrong very quickly. The way it works is, to me, confusing. I know the first encoded string uses an overlap style, so when looping through it, \['a', ' ', (2, 1)... 2 is the distance from the iterator and 1 is the length of the string.

So far, my function essentially just has a stroke. When I tried decoding  ""See Jack run.  Jack runs up the hill.   Jack and Jill roll down."" my output is... well, close. ""See Jack run. Jack runs up the hillack runand Jiu roacdown."" All of my pulled strings are either (or both) too short and not even the right letters. Here is what I have so far.

328,,learnpython,"Hello everyone,

I am new to python and hoping to get some clarification on how I can better use for loops for working with python for working with csv files, xlsx files, and for loops. I have been looking up how to do this extensively for days now and am not getting very far, so I thought this would be a great group to reach out here, since Stack Overflow is kind of intimidating.

So here is the goal with a simplified example:

I have an excel workbook (.xlsx) where the first sheet is just meant for data entry. So just paste data in this sheet. This data that is pasted is provided to me as a .csv file. We'll call this sheet ""Data Entry""

The second sheet in this work book has calculations that are all referenced to the values entered in data entry. We'll call this sheet ""Calculations Below these calculation cells is a single cell that is the sum of all the above calculations. It is the final answer

If I had just one csv file with data, I could easily just copy and paste that into ""Data Entry"", and then boom, there is my final answer in the ""Calculations"" sheet! I'd copy that final answer and paste it where I want. Done!

However, my situation is more complicated. I am presented with 100 csv data files that all need to be run through the workbook, so I need to get 100 final answers. That is way too much work! So I am trying to figure how to automate this with python and for loops.

What I am trying to do with this is make it so that for every data csv file in my directory, I will send it to the workbook to be pasted in the 'Data Entry' sheet. And from these newly created 100 different .xlsx workbooks, I want to get the final answers in the ""Final Answer"" sheet and then organize them into a python dataframe. I am assuming the '\*' operater in ""Data\_\*"" as a wildcard operator so that the code will send each numbered data csv file to the workbook. 

Here is my pseudo code:

    For every csv in directory 
        Paste into ‘workbook’, sheet(‘Data Entry’) 
    For every newly created ‘workbook’ 
        Get final answer values in “Calculations” sheet 
        Organize into python dataframe

This is as far as I have gotten:

    import pandas as pd
    from openpyxl import load_workbook
    import glob, os
    
    for f in glob.iglob(""Data_*.csv""):
        print(f)
        df = pd.read_csv(f)
        book = load_workbook('Workbook.xlsx')
        with pd.ExcelWriter('Workbook.xlsx', engine='openpyxl') as writer:
            writer.book = book
            writer.sheets = dict((ws.title, ws) for ws in book.worksheets)   
            df.to_excel(writer, 'Data Entry', header=True, index=False) 
            writer.save()
    
            final_data = pd.read_excel('Workbook.xlsx', sheet_name='Calculations')
            df2 = pd.DataFrame(final_data)
            final_answer = df2.loc['Row title', 'Column title']
            print(final_answer)

This gets me the following output:

    Data_1.csv
    nan
    Data_2.csv
    nan

How can I get those ""nan"" outputs to actually display the values that excel calculated?

I decided to build the app using Flask for two reasons: 1) The ""micro""-ness and extensibility of Flask seemed appealing, and 2) I found [Miguel Grinberg's multi-part Flask tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) a fantastic introduction to both the framework and the Python ecosystem.

**P.S.** maybe you want to also make sure that your Ubuntu packages are utodate:

~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
apt-get autoremove -y

I'm new to Python, using it for about 2 months now.

Connecting to SQL is very easy; however when I give the exe file to other workers of they don't have access to the network drive it won't work. So I'm trying to find a way that I can connect to the network drive with credentials in my code similar to how I connect to SQL. I have looked into mounting, bit I'm uncomfortable with the idea that if something goes wrong in between, I just mounted a drive into someone who is not supposed to have it.  Is there a way I can virtually connect and read the Excel file, etc without mounting the drive?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am trying to create a app similar to airdrop where a file is sent over the local network to another device. I have written (nearly) everything, and so far, sending and receiving small text and word files work perfectly fine. However, whenever I try to send photos via my application, the photos often are garbled and corrupted.

Stranger yet,  when I try deconstructing my boilerplate code to create a ""diagnostic"" of sorts - that is, stripping out all the bells and whistles like tkinter and a broadcast discovery system to send the same photo, the photo sends perfectly fine. I found this pretty strange, because I literally used the same lines of code (195, 310) in the application - yet the file remains corrupted. I've pasted the code below, and the diagnostic file used.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Photo corruption when using app, but deconstruction and testing of vital functions allows photos to be sent/received with no corruption. No idea where the issue is.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight is welcome :) Thanks in advance.

Im working on a Artist Booking app. where artists play shows at a venue.

This is just a mock project so that I can understand how to better manipulate data

I'm pulling data from a Postgre database. There 3 main tables that relate to each other: ""Artist"", ""Show"", ""Venue""

This is the List with dictionaries in them

\`\`\`

venue\_list = \[  
{'city': 'Asmeth', 'state': 'MI', 'venues': \[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Venue1', 'num\_upcoming\_shows': 0}\]}, 

{'city': 'Burk', 'state': 'AS', 'venues': \[{'id': 2, 'name': 'Venue2', 'num\_upcoming\_shows': 0}\]}, 

{'city': 'Zeffer', 'state': 'AL', 'venues': \[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Venue3', 'num\_upcoming\_shows': 0}\]}, 

{'city': 'Truemanville', 'state': 'HI', 'venues': \[{'id': 4, 'name': 'Venue4', 'num\_upcoming\_shows': 0}\]}, 

{'city': 'Shoalin', 'state': 'NY', 'venues': \[{'id': 5, 'name': 'Venue5', 'num\_upcoming\_shows': 0}\]}, 

{'city': 'Albany', 'state': 'AL', 'venues': \[{'id': 6, 'name': 'Venue6', 'num\_upcoming\_shows': 0}\]}\]

\`\`\`

The second piece in the problem is the dictionary of values  
weekly\_shows = {1: 2, 4: 2, 3: 1, 6: 1}

This is what the numbers mean.  
The **key** is the ID of the Venue, the **value** is  how many shows that venue will be having that week.

What I am trying to do is place the **values** inside *weekly\_shows* inside of the *num\_upcoming\_shows* inside *venues* inside *venue\_list*

I was thinking of something like this to solve the problem:

\`\`\`

counter = 0

for d in data:

for k, v in common.items():

if data\[counter\]\['venues'\]\[0\]\['id'\] == k:

print('Found Match' + data\[counter\]\['venues'\]\[0\]\['name'\])

counter += 1

\`\`\`

I believed that this would go through all the items inside **data** and compare IDs from it with all the available keys inside of **common.**

However the loop seems to only run once. If you run it, it'll fill in the first *num\_upcoming\_shows* for the the first item inside **data** but not the rest.  


I must have a terrible understanding of nested loops.

If someone has a little bit of time, would someone be able to help me understand what is happening?

4. Hanging up the phone at any moment along the way ends this process.

1-3 work perfectly. As the phone is picked up, the switch sends a signal and the playback and then recording starts. I just can't figure out how to make Python continuously check in the background to see if the switch is open again and then interrupt the process. I've looked at threads and subprocesses, but nothing seems to work just right.

Am very grateful for any ideas!

It's given that there's a building with three floors, 0, 1 and 2.The building is equipped with two elevators, L and R and R is favored in the case that both elevators are equally far from the floor from which the call is sent.

Ape quickly arrives at the conclusion that if the call comes from floor 1, there's a high probability that R will be the elevator to respond to the call. L is only activated if it is already on floor 1 and R is on a different floor. So far, so good.

Ape continues to think that there is - in all likelihood - a very clear, concise and logical solution to the Elevator problem (because there always is), however the following chunk of bland pasta is submitted in lieu of sound alternatives:

    def elevator(left, right, call):
        if call == 1 and left != 1:
            return 'right'

377,,learnpython,"Hi all,

To frame this question, I am a beginner Python programmer.

I have a Raspberry Pi setup with a scheduled Python script I created to text my cellphone snowfall forecasts at my local ski mountains. I send the text using smtplib connected to a gmail account sending emails to my corresponding vtext address (verizon text messaging email implementation). The text message shows up on my phone with a sender address of my gmail address. If I respond to the text message on my phone, an email will be sent to my gmail account.

I desire to set up a script on the Pi to monitor that email address for incoming emails, and to execute another script when certain phrases in the emails is detected.

The most basic implementation of this would be to use imaplib in Python and setup cron on the Pi to query the IMAP server every minute or so (cron scheduling is limited to one minute intervals to my understanding). However, I see two issues with this. The first is that I would like the script to detect a new email in a matter of seconds, not minutes. The second is that I am concerned that queries every minute may be flagged by the server and my connection may be kicked.

The first issue would be resolved by having a script constantly running with a wait function to query every few seconds. However, this solution would make my second concern even worse.

I have heard that IMAP supports an idle command, which looks for new data on the server without constantly querying. This functionality sounds perfect for this application. However, Python's imaplib does not support idleing to my knowledge. I have done some searching around and haven't seen any clear documentation from the Python community that discusses this exactly, though I definitely could have missed some pertinent discussions.

My question:

1. Is there a Python library that supports IMAP connections with idle functionality?
2. Is there a better approach to achieve this without using pure text message functionality (like with a GSM device)? I could host a simple email server on the Pi to solely send and receive emails from my verizon texting email address, and that way I wouldn't have to worry about gmail server rate limits. However, I have heard that emails sent from such servers are constantly blacklisted by corporate email servers, so I am not sure if Verizon would detect this and block the text message from being sent (I haven't tried, and I would have to spend some time looking into how to set this up on the Pi).

379,,learnpython,"I'm rewriting a legacy product from C# into Python. I'm still relatively new to Python and have run across something that I don't know a best-practices Pythonic method.

The challenge is that I need to return a single value from a range of systolic, diastolic, and age values, e.g.,

            Blood Pressure Values           ID_AGE
    ID_SCR_BP_SYS   ID_SCR_BP_DIA   &lt; 50    = 50

        &lt; 140           = 95        2.00    1.60

The original legacy product uses 90 lines of `if...else if` statements. I could do the same (to return the values under ID_AGE) but this is just *ugly* and besides,

&gt; Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex. Flat is better than nested. Readability counts.

How can I change the nested `if...elif` to something more Pythonic and, well, pretty and readable?

I already had one response (from /u/anossov) that suggested this:

    MAX_DIA = 500
    AGE_THRESHOLD = 50
    the_data = [
        # ((min_sys, max_sys), (min_dia, max_dia), id_lt_50, id_is_50)
        ((0,   140), (0,  90),     1.0,  1.0),
        ((0,   140), (90, 95),     1.4,  1.4),
        ((0,   140), (95, 96),     2.0,  1.6),
        ((140, 150), (0,  90),     1.2,  1.6),
        ((140, 150), (90, 95),     1.4,  1.6),
        ((140, 150), (95, 96),     2.0,  1.8),
        ((150, 151), (0, MAX_DIA), 2.25, 2.3),
        ]

    def calc_bp_risk(sys, dia, age):
        if age &gt; AGE_THRESHOLD:
            raise Exception(f""Invalid age = {age}"")
    
        for ((min_sys, max_sys), (min_dia, max_dia), lt_50, is_50) in the_data:
            if not (min_sys &lt;= sys &lt; max_sys):
                continue
            if not (min_dia &lt;= dia &lt; max_dia):

            return lt_50 if age &lt; AGE_THRESHOLD else is_50

which I very much appreciate but I would also love to see other potential options, including those that could contain more data tuples that would need to be built in to the `for():` loop.

    140-149         &amp;lt; 90        1.20    1.60
    140-149         90-94       1.40    1.60

    = 150           All         2.25    2.30
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original legacy product uses 90 lines of &lt;code&gt;if...else if&lt;/code&gt; statements. I could do the same (to return the values under ID_AGE) but this is just &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt; and besides,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex. Flat is better than nested. Readability counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I change the nested &lt;code&gt;if...elif&lt;/code&gt; to something more Pythonic and, well, pretty and readable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had one response (from &lt;a href=""/u/anossov""&gt;/u/anossov&lt;/a&gt;) that suggested this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAX_DIA = 500
AGE_THRESHOLD = 50
the_data = [
    # ((min_sys, max_sys), (min_dia, max_dia), id_lt_50, id_is_50)
    ((0,   140), (0,  90),     1.0,  1.0),
    ((0,   140), (90, 95),     1.4,  1.4),
    ((0,   140), (95, 96),     2.0,  1.6),
    ((140, 150), (0,  90),     1.2,  1.6),
    ((140, 150), (90, 95),     1.4,  1.6),
    ((140, 150), (95, 96),     2.0,  1.8),
    ((150, 151), (0, MAX_DIA), 2.25, 2.3),
    ]

def calc_bp_risk(sys, dia, age):
    if age &amp;gt; AGE_THRESHOLD:
        raise Exception(f&amp;quot;Invalid age = {age}&amp;quot;)

    for ((min_sys, max_sys), (min_dia, max_dia), lt_50, is_50) in the_data:
        if not (min_sys &amp;lt;= sys &amp;lt; max_sys):
            continue
        if not (min_dia &amp;lt;= dia &amp;lt; max_dia):
            continue

        return lt_50 if age &amp;lt; AGE_THRESHOLD else is_50

    raise Exception(f&amp;quot;Invalid pressures: {sys}/{dia}&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I very much appreciate but I would also love to see other potential options, including those that could contain more data tuples that would need to be built in to the &lt;code&gt;for():&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;

I finished Automate TBSWP, and it was really good source, to grasp Py fundamentals.
I am mostly interested, at least now, in web scraping with BS4. Therefore I did 2 small courses on Udemy about it, it was OK to get some basics about it. But these 2 courses, like many other tutorials I have found, are not deep enough. I have a feeling it is always a bit too related to the specific webpage they are scraping, I would like to get some more broad knowledge.

Also, to be more specific, my biggest trouble currently is how to get data from multiple tags X that are inside multiple tags Y. Using find_all, always gets me into trouble with errors like ""AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'text'"" etc.

Other problem that I am always having is storing the data. I saw different approaches, write directly to CSV or 1st create list and then write to CSV etc.


Therefore, if anyone can recommend any books, tutorials, courses I would be grateful.

384,,learnpython,"A class object from a project I'm working on generates it's attributes based on the API data it receives. I wrote it in a way so you can treat the class as a [`namedtuple`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) object.

Code snippet:

    import requests
    import collections
    

    class IP:
    
        _API = 'https://api.ipdata.co?api-key=test'
    
        def __init__(self):
            """"""Container for IP information obtained from the 'ipdata.co' API. """"""
            self._as_dict = requests.get(self._API).json()
            self.set_attrs()
    
        def __repr__(self):
            data = collections.namedtuple('ip', self.as_dict.keys())
            return repr(data(*self._as_dict.values()))
    
        def set_attrs(self):
            """"""Generate attributes from API data.""""""
            [setattr(self, key, value) for key, value in self._as_dict.items()]
    
    
    ip = IP()
    print(ip)               # Outputs: ip(ip=..., is_eu=..., city=..., region=..., region_code=..., country_name='United States', country_code=..., etc.)
    print(ip.country_name)  # Outputs: United States

Sorry for title being too non-explanatory. I am currently developing a program with opencv-python and we get image,recognize objects etc. There is a function which is responsible from drawing boxes.

Let's take this search example: https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2210424439%22%5D.

My goal is to get the real names of the employees.

But as you will see, you don't always have access to it.

And when you don't, it is showing ""LinkedIn Member"" with a couple of other information such as job title and location.

So my question is: is there a way to scrape the actual names instead of ""LinkedIn Member""?

What I have try: (there is no code yet, I am just trying to figure out how LinkedIn is working)

\-Reverse image searching: I took the url of an employee profile picture and do some reverse search image. It works but only for those who have a profile picture (most of them seems not to have one).

\-I tried to inspect the different calls in the Network tab on Chrome DevTools, but I don't really understand what is going on.

\-I parse through the html document and I found some attribute called data-control-id  
. It takes this form data-control-id = ""Dqo2kn3uT7SvcucsrEIz3Q==""  
. It seems like there is one unique for each employee profile. But still I don't know what do to about it and how to find how this is connected to the employee's name or profile.

Hello community,

I am trying to implement a binary search tree and the first step I am working on is adding data points to the tree. In trying to recursively call the add method, instead of self.add() which would operate on the current Node, I used self.right|left.add(). Now you can see at the point of this call, self.right|left is a NoneType. How does it get to call add() method on it? Also, what would be a better way, if any, to implement this, so it becomes something like self.add(left|right Node, value).

    data['type'], data['side'], data['amount'],
    calc_price(data['price']), {'leverage': data['leverage']})

From the Apache error log:

417,,learnpython,"TL;DR-  I'd like to thank all of r/learnpython from the bottom of my heart for being an amazing and helpful resource from day 1 of my python journey.  Never give up on programming, and never stop learning. Practice, practice, practice.

One year ago, I started out with zero programming experience and zero security experience. I got placed in my high school's technology course to fill out my schedule. I spent about two weeks watching Bob Ross and following along in MS Paint before my teacher recommended that I learn something useful. He mentioned something called Python, and told me to look into it. I immediately fell in love with it. It was fun to use, easy to write, and extremely flexible. I struggled a lot when I first started, and my first program took me longer than I care to admit. It was extremely simple:

    num = int(input(""Enter the number: ""))
    if num == 1000:
        print(""The number is 1000"")
    elif num &gt; 1000:
        print(""The number is greater than 1000"")
    elif num &lt; 1000:
        print(""The number is less than 1000"")
    for i in range(num, 0, -1):
        print(str(i))

I struggled for three days with type errors and the loop threw me for a loop. It was frustrating, but the feeling of reward and pride when I saw those numbers printed out correctly inspired me to stick with it. Those, in my opinion, are the two most useful virtues to have when learning programming: passion and perseverance. I poured time into Python, spending 6-7 hours a day programming and the rest thinking up projects and reading reddit posts about programming.

Not long after, I decided to move on from small programming exercises and start a real project. I found that picking a project that forced me to learn new things about python greatly helped me. I wrote a text based dungeon crawler, and it taught me about classes, function, and dictionaries. It's a hot mess (4k lines of insane code- [you can see it here, in all its nasty glory](https://github.com/Mili-NT/Dungeon-Of-The-Silver-Key)). I was proud of it, and I honestly still am. The location system was insanely difficult for a new programmer, and it even drove me to tears on a few occasions. I was so proud I decided to enter it in my state's technology competition in project programming.  I won local and districts, but didn't place at state.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I discovered my other passion: cybersecurity. Like I did with Python, I fell in love with it and spent hours upon hours reading, doing CTF exercises, and messing around with networking. I decided that cybersecurity was what I wanted to do with my life. Just like python, what helped me most here was hands-on practice and time. Getting stuck in a cycle of reading and not practicing is easy, but you only really learn by doing. Doing hack the boxes, Capture The Flags (such as the ones at [over the wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)), and messing around with vulnerable VMs like DVWA and Metasploitable was crucial to learning for me.

Over the summer, I got an entry level IT support job with a contractor that worked with my high school. It was a lot of grunt labor at first, hauling obsolete systems off for disposal and such. As the summer progressed, we started updating chromebooks by hand for 9 hours a day. I was bored as all hell, so I turned once again to python. I wrote a small script to scrape public text documents off of pastebin. It was slow, got banned every 40 minutes or so, and really was just a stream of random data deposited in a onedrive folder for me to look through.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer and through the year, I honed it into the crown jewel of my python projects. It went from a shitty script made from boredom to a tool for malware collection and data analysis. I dubbed it [BinBot](https://github.com/Mili-NT/BinBot) and worked on it constantly. I decided to enter it in the tech competition again. I swept locals, and impressed the judges so much that one judge offered to put in a recommendation to a manager he knew for a part time job at the google HQ in Atlanta.

Today was the regional competition. I presented BinBot as an open source threat intelligence program. I demonstrated how it worked, what it's potential in a security workflow was, and to accompany it, I walked the judges through an analysis of an Emotet sample I did. I showed how BinBot alerted me to a potentially malicious URL, how I retrieved the malicious word doc and deobfuscated the powershell payload, and fetched the live payload from a compromised domain and ran it through HybridAnalysis. They were extremely impressed, and I won first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, the regional IT supervisor and the head of the board of education came up to me and offered me a job as a Database Administrator. They said the old admin has retired, and that they wanted to hire me. The work is fully remote and has government benefits, which means I can continue doing it when I go off to college. I'll be setting up, writing queries for, and maintaining every database in the entire district. I'm extremely excited and grateful.

Thank all of you for helping me, answering my stupid questions, and never stop learning. Hack on, brothers.

Never give up on programming, and never stop learning. Practice, practice, practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year ago, I started out with zero programming experience and zero security experience. I got placed in my high school&amp;#39;s technology course to fill out my schedule. I spent about two weeks watching Bob Ross and following along in MS Paint before my teacher recommended that I learn something useful. He mentioned something called Python, and told me to look into it. I immediately fell in love with it. It was fun to use, easy to write, and extremely flexible. I struggled a lot when I first started, and my first program took me longer than I care to admit. It was extremely simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;num = int(input(&amp;quot;Enter the number: &amp;quot;))
if num == 1000:
    print(&amp;quot;The number is 1000&amp;quot;)
elif num &amp;gt; 1000:
    print(&amp;quot;The number is greater than 1000&amp;quot;)
elif num &amp;lt; 1000:
    print(&amp;quot;The number is less than 1000&amp;quot;)
for i in range(num, 0, -1):
    print(str(i))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled for three days with type errors and the loop threw me for a loop. It was frustrating, but the feeling of reward and pride when I saw those numbers printed out correctly inspired me to stick with it. Those, in my opinion, are the two most useful virtues to have when learning programming: passion and perseverance. I poured time into Python, spending 6-7 hours a day programming and the rest thinking up projects and reading reddit posts about programming.&lt;/p&gt;

class Frequency(object):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    DO NOT MODIFY THIS CLASS.
    Stores a letter:frequency pair.
    The repr for printing will be of the form &amp;lt;item, frequency&amp;gt;
    See the example below
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f = Frequency(&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, 2)
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f.letter
    &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f.frequency
    2
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f)
    &amp;lt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 2&amp;gt;
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

    def __init__(self, letter, frequency):
        self.letter = letter
        self.frequency = frequency
        self.next = None

    def __repr__(self):
        return (&amp;#39;&amp;lt;&amp;#39; +
                repr(self.letter) + &amp;#39;: &amp;#39; + str(self.frequency) +

class SortedFrequencyList(object):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    Stores a collection of Frequency objects as a sorted linked list.
    Items are sorted from the highest frequency to the lowest.
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am trying to implement an &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; function that inserts the letter and frequency in order like a node:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     def add(self, letter, frequency=1):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        Adds the given letter and frequency combination as a Frequency object
        to the list. If the given letter is already in the list, the given
        frequency is added to its frequency.

        If the updated frequency is greater than the frequency of the previous
        node then it should be moved into order, ie, so that it is after
        all items with the same or greater frequency.

        If the letter is not in the list then the new frequency object should be
        added to the list so that it is after all letters
        with the same or higher frequency.

        Adding new letters with frequency 1 should be the sole usage case in
        this assignment and you can make your code more efficient if you treat
        letters with frequency of 1 as a special case. But, your code should
        still deal with the more general case, eg, my_list.add(&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, 4)

        Of course, if there are no letters in the list
        then the new item should be added at the head.

        The doctests below should make it clear how this method should work.
        Hint: you should have code similar to this in your answers to lab 3 :)

        You will probably want to use a helper function.
        YOU MUST write some more doctests for this method.

420,,learnpython,"I'm currently making a module and it includes a class and a function. The class is used to create objects, onto which the function operates.

The function needs to have access to some sort of constant data. For example, let's say the function is the following:

    def test(x, y): #x, y are two objects of the class
        #initialize function
        d = {1 : ""test"", 2 : ""hello"", 3 : ""world""}
        s = {1, 5, 15}
        v = 5
        #operate on objects
        pass

Now a function like that would work, but my issue with it is that it essentially needs to initialize itself every time it is called. This means that, in this example, memory for `d`, `s` and `v` would be allocated at the start of the function, used and then freed when the function exits. Next time the function is called, this process would have to start over.

I feel like this is inefficient and I can think of various solutions for it, but I'm not sure which one would be the most ""pythonic"" way to do it. I could turn `test` into a class, then initialize an instance of it, include all of the above variables inside of `__init__` and use a method of it to operate on the objects, but that seems like an overkill and also makes the method harder to use; I would prefer to keep it as a function.

The other solution I can think of is to create a class that just acts as a storage container for these values, so they can be accessed directly from that class whenever the function runs. That also seems like a weird way to deal with this.

I am aware of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34430314/lifetime-memory-scope-of-local-variables-inside-a-function) stackoverflow question, where the same thing is being asked, however the answers suggest that the data be allocated inside of the calling function, or be global. The former is not possible in my case, because this is a module that you'd be importing and using. All the data the function uses is ""hidden"" from the user, so they shouldn't be the ones passing it to it. The latter is something I always avoid doing and I'd definitely prefer not to do it here, either.

Given a number 25:

floor(log2(25))=**4**

25-2\*\***4**=9

&amp;#x200B;

floor(log2(9))=**3**

9-2\*\***3**=1

&amp;#x200B;

floor(log2(1))=**0**

1-2\*\***0**=0      #base case: terminate when 0 is reached

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, position 0,3 and 4 have 1's while the other positions are filled with 0's i.e. 11001

&amp;#x200B;

Another example: 28

floor(log2(28))=**4**

28-2\*\***4**=12

&amp;#x200B;

floor(log2(12))=**3**

12-2\*\***3**=4

floor(log2(4))=**2**

4-2\*\***2**=0 #base case: terminate when 0 is reached

28 to binary is thus 11100

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to mimic this particular code ""format"" for recursion (sums 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9+...)

Here is the recurrence relation

If n is even:

f(n)=f(n-1)-1/(3+2(n-2))

If n is odd:

f(n)=f(n-1)+1/(3+2(n-2))

    def test(n):   
        if n%2==0:
            if n==1:
                return 1
            else:
                return test(n-1)-1*(3+2*(n-2))**-1
        else:
            if n==1:
                return 1
            else:
                return test(n-1)+1*(3+2*(n-2))**-1

So the recurrence relation for the binary problem seems to be
f(n)=f(n-1)-2**floor(log2(f(n-1)))
f(0)=n

And here's the gibberish I have so far:

    import math as m
    def test(n):
        if n==1:
            return 25
        else:
            return test(n-1)-2**m.floor(m.log2(test(n-1)))

Thank you very much for any aid!",t2_cnbql,False,,0,False,Don't know where to begin with recursive program that converts decimal number to binary,[],r/learnpython,False,6,,0,False,t3_euktkm,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580139915.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnpython,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have found other recursive programs that divide by 2 but I have not found one that resembles mine. However I cannot implement my method in Python. Here&amp;#39;s my thought process from my own experimentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a number 25:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floor(log2(25))=&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25-2**&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;=9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floor(log2(9))=&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9-2**&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floor(log2(1))=&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1-2**&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;=0      #base case: terminate when 0 is reached&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, position 0,3 and 4 have 1&amp;#39;s while the other positions are filled with 0&amp;#39;s i.e. 11001&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: 28&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floor(log2(28))=&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28-2**&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;=12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floor(log2(12))=&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12-2**&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;=4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floor(log2(4))=&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4-2**&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;=0 #base case: terminate when 0 is reached&lt;/p&gt;

An example from chapter 5 of ATBSWP [gist of the full program here](https://gist.github.com/Elmlea/2c833668ce5af9636e3811ed393650a3):

    def totalBrought(guests, item):
    numBrought = 0
    for k, v in guests.items():
        numBrought = numBrought + v.get(item,0)
    return numBrought

What I struggle with is figuring out how many times that loop will run, especially when there's 2 variables associated with it.  

I understand that k &amp; v are used for placeholder for the keys and values of the dictionary specified:

    allGuests = {'Alice': {'apples': 5, 'pretzels': 12},
    'Bob': {'ham sandwiches': 3, 'apples': 2},
    'Carol': {'cups': 3, 'apple pies': 1}}

I can't quite phrase in natural language what the loop's doing.  I think that guests.items() returns the items in the dictionary as key-value pairs, so the for loop is going to iterate through once for each key-value pair.

It then calls the get method on v, so checking if whatever's been called in 'item' exists as a key anywhere in v, which is the nested dictionary.  The resulting number is added to the previous number before the loop restarts.

If I've got that right, it doesn't seem natural yet, and it's a real struggle when I try to solve example puzzles as I just can't parse loops naturally in my mind yet.

I have an idea for a tool but I need to know few info that I really can't get answers for from googling. 

Can I have multiple decorators?

If yes, does the first decorator interactions will be noticeable in the second decorator?

My plan is to have multiple decorators that start at the same time and each one doesn't interfere with the other one. and without executing the function multiple times (if 5 decorators, 5 executions). Is it something actually realistic?

    Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.
    Return your answer as a number.

One of the answers:

    def sum_mix(arr):
        return sum(int(n) for n in arr)

And it works. Why don't I need to surround the argument with \[\]?

    [int(n) for n in arr]

By itself the argument in the solution raises an error, but works in function parameters:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; int(n) for n in arr

Explanation:

&gt;When you run this program, you’ll see that it works the same as theprevious magic8Ball.py program.  
&gt;  
&gt;Notice the expression you use as the index into messages: random.randint(0, len(messages) - 1). This produces a random number to usefor the index, regardless of the size of messages. That is, you’ll get a random number between 0 and the value of len(messages) - 1. The benefit of this approach is that you can easily add and remove strings to the messages list without changing other lines of code. If you later update your code, there will be fewer lines you have to change and fewer chances for you to introduce bugs.

533,,learnpython,"I wrote my first real program to automate logging into different servers for work. I simply store all my information (Server name, URL, Username and Password) in a local csv file and my Python program reads this file as a dataframe and prompts the user to select which server they want to use and proceeds to open the URL and log me in. It seems to be working well, but I want to learn how to write better code, so I posted about this earlier and got some feedback, however I have a specific question now.

Should I create a class called server that has some attributes (name, URL, username, password) and a function such as server.login? Is there value in doing that compared to simply using variables? Note that this program only logs you in once every execution, so there will only be one instance of the class every execution.

&amp;#x200B;

I simply store all my information (Server name, URL, Username and Password) in a local csv file and my Python program reads this file as a dataframe and prompts the user to select which server they want to use and proceeds to open the URL and log me in. It seems to be working well, but I want to learn how to write better code, so I posted about this earlier and got some feedback, however I have a specific question now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I create a class called server that has some attributes (name, URL, username, password) and a function such as server.login? Is there value in doing that compared to simply using variables? Note that this program only logs you in once every execution, so there will only be one instance of the class every execution.&lt;/p&gt;

    print(&amp;#39;ID\tServer name&amp;#39;)

    userSelection = int(input(&amp;quot;Select an ID: &amp;quot;))
    print(&amp;#39;\n\nUser selected server: &amp;#39; + data.Server.values[userSelection])
    username = data.Username.values[userSelection]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

538,,learnpython,"I'm fairly new to python, but not entirely new to programming. I'm trying to use this python module https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws to retrieve orders information from my Amazon Seller account.

I don't have any issues connecting to the api and pulling orders or order items, but it's not clear to me how best to work with the nested dictionary structures that are returned.

For instance, querying a list of order items

    orders_api.list_order_items(order_id)

returns a DictObject with a a bunch of nested DictObjects for the values of the attributes of an order_item. Here is one of those attributes

    TaxCollection = {'value': '\n ', 'ResponsibleParty': {'value': 'Amazon Services, Inc.'}, 'Model': {'value': 'MarketplaceFacilitator'}}


What is the point of having every value part of it's own dict? Why not just do this

     TaxCollection = {'ResponsibleParty': 'Amazon Services, Inc.', 'Model': 'MarketplaceFacilitator'}

And what why is there the extra empty 'value': '\n ', which appears through the objects returned with this module. It is in every level of the nested dicts.

There is obviously a good reason it's structured this way and I""m sure it probably makes iterating through the nested ObjectDicts and working with the data much easier in same way, but I'm not seeing it. 

I've also found that the returned structure isn't always consistent and that makes it harder to work with. For instance, when querying an orders items if the there is only one order item the  object returned is and ObjectDict, however, if there are more than one item then it returns a list of ObjectDict. So when checking the value of the returned item I need to check first it it's an dict or a list before I can work with it. Would it not have been easier to be consistent and simply return a list of ObjectDict with one item in the list?  

Anyway, as I said, I'm sure there is a easy way to work with these ObjectDicts that are returned and I'm probably making a lot of work when less is needed simply because I'm still fairly new to python. Any help or guidance on how to navigate through these objects would be very much appreciated. Also, if anyone knows of any good example code or open source projects projects that use this module I'd be grateful if you'd share. Thanks.

EDIT; Also whether a key/value pair will be in the dictionary seems to be a bit arbitrary and makes requiring to check every key/value exists first. For example in some cases the order_item dictionary has an entry for PromotionalDiscount and in some cases it doesn't not include this key/value pair.

I&amp;#39;m trying to use this python module &lt;a href=""https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws""&gt;https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve orders information from my Amazon Seller account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any issues connecting to the api and pulling orders or order items, but it&amp;#39;s not clear to me how best to work with the nested dictionary structures that are returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, querying a list of order items&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;orders_api.list_order_items(order_id)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;returns a DictObject with a a bunch of nested DictObjects for the values of the attributes of an order_item. Here is one of those attributes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TaxCollection = {&amp;#39;value&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;\n &amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ResponsibleParty&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;value&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Amazon Services, Inc.&amp;#39;}, &amp;#39;Model&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;value&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;MarketplaceFacilitator&amp;#39;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the point of having every value part of it&amp;#39;s own dict? Why not just do this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; TaxCollection = {&amp;#39;ResponsibleParty&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Amazon Services, Inc.&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Model&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;MarketplaceFacilitator&amp;#39;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what why is there the extra empty &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;\n &amp;#39;, which appears through the objects returned with this module. It is in every level of the nested dicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is obviously a good reason it&amp;#39;s structured this way and I&amp;quot;m sure it probably makes iterating through the nested ObjectDicts and working with the data much easier in same way, but I&amp;#39;m not seeing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also found that the returned structure isn&amp;#39;t always consistent and that makes it harder to work with. For instance, when querying an orders items if the there is only one order item the  object returned is and ObjectDict, however, if there are more than one item then it returns a list of ObjectDict. So when checking the value of the returned item I need to check first it it&amp;#39;s an dict or a list before I can work with it. Would it not have been easier to be consistent and simply return a list of ObjectDict with one item in the list?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as I said, I&amp;#39;m sure there is a easy way to work with these ObjectDicts that are returned and I&amp;#39;m probably making a lot of work when less is needed simply because I&amp;#39;m still fairly new to python. Any help or guidance on how to navigate through these objects would be very much appreciated. Also, if anyone knows of any good example code or open source projects projects that use this module I&amp;#39;d be grateful if you&amp;#39;d share. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT; Also whether a key/value pair will be in the dictionary seems to be a bit arbitrary and makes requiring to check every key/value exists first. For example in some cases the order_item dictionary has an entry for PromotionalDiscount and in some cases it doesn&amp;#39;t not include this key/value pair. However, even when it is included it is often set to $0 when there is no discount. So why not include the pair all the time and set the discount to zero making the object consistent?&lt;/p&gt;

541,,learnpython,"Hi, first post here but I have a few friends that have recommended this place to get some friendly help or advice on problems that I am unable to solve myself.

I was wondering if someone could help me figure this out (I only started learning python 1 week ago so go easy on this code):

While I was coding for another project, my little sister asked me to help her with her math homework on solving quadratic equations. After I explained the process of solving the equations to her, I got curious. I wondered if I could code a program that could calculate all of the answers to the questions on her homework sheet so that I could check her answers when she was done. (Good way to kill two birds with one stone).

&amp;#x200B;

So I started with the quadratic formula: 

    x = (-b +/- sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)

&amp;#x200B;

Then established the three conditions for an answer based on the discriminant.

* If the discriminant (b\*\*2 - 4 \* a \* c) is positive, then there are two distinct roots.
* If the discriminant is zero, then there is only one root.
* If the discriminant is negative, then there are no real roots.

I placed the discriminant in a variable like this to be compared to:

    d = b**2 - 4 * a * c

&amp;#x200B;

Then for each question, I stored the a, b, and c values in a list like so:

    list_a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]
    list_b = [5, 13, 2, 1, 11, 6, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 4]
    list_c = [3, 7, -13, -11, -13, 3, -7, -1, -11, -63, -25, -20]

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's naive and probably very inefficient, but my idea was to iterate through these three lists simultaneously and plug in the respective values. So list\_a\[0\], list\_b\[0\], and list\_c\[0\] would get plugged into the equation first as a, b, and c, and then I would iterate to list\_a\[1\], list\_b\[1\], and list\_c\[1\] and so on.

So here's what I got so far, but there is an issue, and if I were to take a guess, it would be with the three for loops at the start of the function. I'm not sure I fully understand the way for loops work. The problem is that it is kicking out some correct answers, some duplicate answers, and some just straight up wrong answers. I think I may have a problem with how I am updating the list position as well but I don't know enough to tell if that's true.

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I have a bunch of test methods with repeated code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def tests_camera_properties(self, m):
m.get(CONST.OAUTH_TOKEN_URL, text=OAUTH_CLAIMS.get_response_ok())
    m.post(CONST.LOGOUT_URL, text=LOGOUT.post_response_ok())
    m.get(CONST.PANEL_URL, text=PANEL.get_response_ok(mode=CONST.MODE_STANDBY))
    m.get(CONST.DEVICES_URL, text=self.all_devices)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if there&amp;#39;s a way I can move all of this to the setUp method. I&amp;#39;m using the &lt;code&gt;@requests_mock.Mocker()&lt;/code&gt; decorator above my test class and I thought it would be as simple as moving the repeated code into the &lt;code&gt;setUp&lt;/code&gt; method and adding the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;setUp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def setUp(self, m):
m.post(CONST.LOGIN_URL, text=LOGIN.post_response_ok())
m.get(CONST.OAUTH_TOKEN_URL, text=OAUTH_CLAIMS.get_response_ok())
m.post(CONST.LOGOUT_URL, text=LOGOUT.post_response_ok())
m.get(CONST.PANEL_URL, text=PANEL.get_response_ok(mode=CONST.MODE_STANDBY))
m.get(CONST.DEVICES_URL, text=self.all_devices)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this throws an error when trying to run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TypeError: setUp() missing 1 required positional argument: &amp;#39;m&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it appears the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; argument isn&amp;#39;t passed to the &lt;code&gt;setUp&lt;/code&gt; method, but is passed to every other test method. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m screwing something up or perhaps there&amp;#39;s another way to go about this. :)&lt;/p&gt;

Im currently writing an updater to my program. How it works:  
1) when the main program is ran, it checks my git website for the latest version  
2) if there is a new version, it asks the user if they want to update  
3) if they say Ok, the program should run the external updater app i wrote, and exit itself, so the program exe can be rewritten.  
  
This is where i have an issue.  
  
    def version_check():
        try:
            link = urllib.request.urlopen(website).read()

If you screen through papers and want to collect important graphs, you may want to track from which pdf file the extracts came from.

The script creates a copy of a folder full of input pdfs and adds watermarks containing the corresponding pdf filename (or part of it) to each page. (Transparency/color/density of watermarks can be adjusted.) Like this, you'll see the filename on the extracted image.

Hope this will help someone.

I'm trying to write python code to help me convert CSV data into a spreadsheet format to help me out with my monthly budgeting. I spend on my Monzo card, which allows me to put my spending into categories, which match the categories of my spreadsheet. I can download a CSV file with all my spending on each month, which is presented like this:

|id|created|amount|currency|local\_amount|local\_currency|category|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|tx\_00009qebErr|2020-01-02T18:51:28Z|\-2.2|GBP|\-2.2|GBP|Transport|
|tx\_00009qedrew|2020-01-04T20:54:28Z|\-6.45|GBP|\-6.45|GBP|Groceries|

and this is my spreadsheet format i'd like to convert it too:

|||Groceries|Transport|etc|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|01/01/20|07/01/20|£6.45|£2.2||
|08/01/20|14/01/20|£....|£.....||

I understand this might be quite simple to a lot of people, but point in the right direction on the subjects or specific code to learn would be great.  I'd ideally like to automate it so once i download the CSV file i can run the script and it will automatically populate the spreadsheet in the above format. 

Any help would be much appreciated.

What I've got is a class called page() that holds a number of attributes like name, id, description, input prompts, etc. **Most importantly there are .parent and .children attributes initialized to empty lists**.  I'm also passing in a couple of parameters, specifically:

        __init__(self, _name, _parent = """"):

And suddenly both objects are appended to each other.  If I call upon option's children, I'll get \_difficulty and whatever other children I initialize, and if I call on their parent I get \_options.

I intend to use this in conjunction with a function that gets passed a page object, displays and inputs its display and prompt attributes, loops through to match input to some identifier, and then recursively calls itself, now with the identified target page passed in as the new parameter.

&lt;p&gt;{**{dic_comprehension1}, **{dic_comprehension2}, ... **{dic_comprehensionN}}, but I&amp;#39;m feeling lazy. I&amp;#39;ll do it if I must, but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure whether there&amp;#39;s another option.&lt;/p&gt;

Managed to fix it with a bit of logic change to the function, only really works because of the cases that the value of ""col"" is ""None"" is when nothing has been clicked. Unfortunately, this doesn't stop user's from clicking other things in the code and having those run, though that can be remedied with checking the value of Colour.

    def changeColour(col):
        global Colour, ColourPicker

**Original post:**

Simplified, I've got a frame that contains labels that are bound to a function on clicked. The function that's ran updates the window to allow this frame to be seen, set's a variable to the value given by either the button (a string value), or by other functions (a NoneType value) . It then proceeds to wait until the NoneType value is no-longer a NoneType value, i.e. one of these labels have been clicked. During this time period, I'm trying to make it so that they user is unable to interact with anything other than these buttons, however, the method I've employed to do this has resulted in being able to not-interact with anything (due to the nature of time.sleep()), as well as not being very efficient.

I don't think Tkinter's ""wait\_variable"" will work due to it not being a Tkinter variable.

(**EDIT**: going to try and see if I can manage to get multi-threading to work for this case, though tkinter isn't the most multi-threading friendly)

597,,learnpython,"Hi everyone,

This is probably going to sound stupid, but I want to ask anyway. I tried to get into Python a few times now, but I kept changing my resources (ATBS, MIT course, Grinberg Flask book, etc). Then recently, I started with The Odin Project and I feel like this is finally helping me to stay focused. The downside is that they teach Ruby and RoR, and while they now offer the JS/NodeJS track, I don't think that I'd want to go down that route right now. 

I just don't know if I should just learn Ruby and then switch to Python once I get the big picture, or if I'm just wasting months of my life with a language I'm not planning on fully pursuing. 

Another option that I recently thought of is to use the Ruby and RoR projects as a road map, but try to complete them in Python and Django/Flask. The Odin Project only links to resources anyways, so I could just do my own research.

It's the top2000, consisting of the 2000 best songs of all time according to the dutch population (its kinda a new years tradition). I'm guesstimating that about 1800 of the 2000 songs overlap with the year before every year. So I would like to aggregate among those lists. 

However, I'm pretty certain, that considering I'll have to scrape from different sources, there will be some differences in exact spelling. For example:

BLØF - Zoutelande  
Blof - Zoutelande  
Blof ft Geike Arneart - Zoutelande

Led Zeppelin - Stairway to heaven (live: in blabla stadium)

I'm sure you can imagine how these kinds of inconsistencies are so easy for humans, but I'm struggling to think of a way to practically automate this. I was invisioning something like: if it's a 90%+ match, just match them and create a seperate list in which you keep track of the automatically matched songs so I could read through it and identify errors. If it's 80-90% put it in a 'let human decide'-list and below 80% no match. 

However, percentages are tricky for short song names like ABBA - SOS, (both pallindromes though)  
Also, if an featuring artist is added or omited to the string, that has a huge impact. So some sort of 100% match in substrings should also be a factor.

I'm currenly reading up on the documentation of Regex, but i've got the feeling that is best put to use if you already know what kind of pattern a string should follow, this needs to recognize that itself.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure you can imagine how these kinds of inconsistencies are so easy for humans, but I&amp;#39;m struggling to think of a way to practically automate this. I was invisioning something like: if it&amp;#39;s a 90%+ match, just match them and create a seperate list in which you keep track of the automatically matched songs so I could read through it and identify errors. If it&amp;#39;s 80-90% put it in a &amp;#39;let human decide&amp;#39;-list and below 80% no match. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, percentages are tricky for short song names like ABBA - SOS, (both pallindromes though)&lt;br/&gt;
Also, if an featuring artist is added or omited to the string, that has a huge impact. So some sort of 100% match in substrings should also be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currenly reading up on the documentation of Regex, but i&amp;#39;ve got the feeling that is best put to use if you already know what kind of pattern a string should follow, this needs to recognize that itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could anybody provide me with some concept(idea)s I could take a look at to start thinking about? I&amp;#39;m kinda stuck on how to do it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

first of all, I am sorry for my bad English and poor explanation of the code.

So I am currently working on a python code and found out that inside 2x for-loop I work with an array variable that does not work properly. The structure is like:

I have also used print on the ""BN\_1\[k\] + BA\_1\[k\]\*(10\*\*(-h)))"" and the output was just smaller than 0, but not 0 at all. somehow python seems to pass on the values and then sets it to 0 automatically?

So  I have this program that gives you back various operations based on user inputs. That's all fine, but now I want to be able to easily set up a bias that will act as a multiplier for all the output values. I'm not quite sure how to do this. Below is my code. 

Code:

    class summation():
    
    
        def __init__(self, num_1, num_2):
    
            self.add_1 = (num_1 + num_2)
            self.multiply = (num_1 * num_2) 
            self.divide = (num_1 / num_2) 
            self.difference = (num_1 - num_2)
    
    
        def summate(self):
            return '{}'.format(self.add_1)
    
        def mult(self):
            return '{}'.format(self.multiply)
    
        def divis(self):
            return '{}'.format(self.divide)
    
        def diff(self):
            return '{}'.format(self.difference)
    
    
    input_values = summation(int(input()), int(input()), float(input()))
    
    
    print('Sum =', input_values.add_1)
    print('Multiplied =', input_values.multiply)
    print('Divided =', input_values.divide)
    print('The difference between the two values is ',input_values.difference)

I had one idea of embedding the the bias as a third argument within the \_\_init\_\_ and so the user would set the bias up each time. This looks like this;  


       def __init__(self, num_1, num_2, bias):
    
            self.add_1 = (num_1 + num_2) * bias
            self.multiply = (num_1 * num_2) * bias
            self.divide = (num_1 / num_2) * bias
            self.difference = (num_1 - num_2) * bias
    
    input_values = summation(int(input()), int(input()), float(input()))
    

&amp;#x200B;

However, this looks a bit shit to me. I'd rather not have the user set the bias and I'd rather have a better way of not applying the bias, rather than just setting it to 1 in the user input. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas for a better idea?

I got it to ask the user for their choice twice after asking for their name, but after writing the third choice the code just ends. I also cannot get answer\_1 or answer\_2 as variables, but I have seen some others do it.

I have attempted simply changing the names (answer\_1 and answer\_2 to change the variable), I have tried .strip instead of .split (some video mentioned that, so the answers would be all lowercase and count for the same, even if all caps). I have tried str(input( and I have tried eval(input( as well before the answers.

I'm wondering, how do I have my code continue, and not stop so randomly?

Here's the code:

&amp;#x200B;

        print (""You've finally woken up... What is your name?"")
        myName = input ()
        for Name in myName:
        print (""Oh, of course. We remember you, "" + myName)
        answer_1 = input(""It's dark, and there is something growling behind you. What path do you take? (Right/Left) "")
            if answer_1 == ""Right"":
            answer_1 == input(""In your panic, you tripped over a branch. It's getting closer. Do you hide, or get up and keep going? (Hide/Keep going)"" )
            if answer_1 == ""Hide"":
               print(""You roll over into some bushes. Just in time! The growling gets quieter. Do you wait, or go out and check? (Wait/Check)"" )
        elif answer_1 == ""Keep running"":
               print(""Too slow, it got you. Maybe next time,"" + myName)

and then I simply get:"" **...Program finished with exit code 0**

I recently found out that I will not be able to apply any skills that I learn at my job. Reason being is that upper management doesn't want us using the programs - they prefer us to field any suggestions to the team that is the experts with programming.

I am revisiting the old TicTacToe to try and make some improvements since my skills have improved over the past few months of my learning, however I can't understand the logic of the simple tuple unpacking player-choice function.

Here is the working code which returns a tuple of (X,O) to be used in tuple unpacking as player1,player2.

    def player_1_choose_marker():
        choosing = True
        while choosing:
            choice = str(input(""Player 1: Are you X or O?"")).strip().upper()
            if choice != 'X' and choice != 'O':
                print(f""You chose {choice} and it must be an X or O. Lowercase is fine."")
                choosing = True
            if choice == 'X':
                choosing = False
                return ('X','O')
            if choice == 'O':
                choosing = False
                return ('O','X')

So this works just fine.

However, I spent the last half an hour ripping my hair out because the initial validation check was:

    if choice != 'X' or choice != 'O':

(if you didn't see it, OR)

I expected the script to be just that.. if choice is not X or O, then force the user to resubmit.

Whereas AND should surely mean if not X \*and\* O, which of course isn't logical since you can only be X or O, not X and O.

To compound my confusion, the following works as logically expected:

    test = 'X'
    
    if test == 'X' or test == 'O':
        print(""X or O"")
    else:
        print(""Something else"")

this prints ""X or O""; inkeeping with my initial logic.

So, why is the AND functioning as Or in my function?

        f.seek(-2,2)
        while f.read(1) != b""\n"":

        last = f.readline().decode(""utf-8"")
    handle = re.compile(r'(\d+)')

    print(result)
    print(last)
    i = int(result[0])
    next_squared = int(result[1])
    iteration = 500000
    with open('numbers.txt', 'w') as writer:
        while iteration &gt;= 0 :
            n = int(i) + 1

So it basically did everything I wanted it to do, however when I checked the output file the other night it had erased all the file except one line of values.

I want the file to read the last line, pull the two values from that line, then supply them to the index value and ""next\_squared"" \[when I initialize the program\]

Last night I got it to work, but it wasn't behaving the way I had hoped.

&amp;#x200B;

**I also would like to start it up from 0**, as I'm using two versions of this code to do the project. One without the read segment and has 'i' and 'next\_squared' hard coded into it. I cannot use this code to start the process because it gives me an error.

The program will generate every squared whole number. This is not a school assignment, this is a ""for-fun"" project that I am working on.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I need to generate every squared number for this project so it's important that every line gets written to the file.

Hey all, I have this type of data structure in this program. I want to be able to close the program and then the next time I open it, the same data (meaning all instances are initialised with the same values) is available.

My first idea was to save a representation of the data to a file (e.g. a.txt, b.txt) and then read it on the next run. Easy enough to do with class A, but any class that takes another class as an init arg are where I struggle. I searched around and asked a few people and found serialisation is what I need to look into. I'm currently reading the files line by line and then using eval(line), where line is A(""One"", 1) etc. I can immediately see the issues with this and I had been warned about evals safety issues. I asked on a discord and got the answers: pickle,which looks promising but apparently falls into the same traps as eval; json, which is super useful but I don't know if you can use it with custom classes; and finally just to write my own serialiser/deserialiser.

I would like to be able to use the same read and write functions for each file as that makes expanding to more custom classes easier.

Any ideas on how I can solve this problem?

The purpose of this script will be to control a measurement setup that should run for let's say 1000 cycles, but I would like to be able to break it in between to change so parameters.

&lt;p&gt;I am currently starting to use PyQt5 and created my first GUI. Now I would like a program that does the following. When Button &amp;#39;start&amp;#39; is pressed execute &amp;#39;function&amp;#39; n-times until Button &amp;#39;stop&amp;#39; is pressed (imagine a stopwatch)  if I press Button &amp;#39;start&amp;#39; again &amp;#39;function&amp;#39; gets once again executed and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I tried so far is the following, that can not work, since we are not able to change a variable from outside the loop (mockup-script)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Ui(QtWidgets.QDialog):

        self.startScan.clicked.connect(self.startPressed)

        self.pauseScan = self.findChild(QtWidgets.QPushButton, &amp;#39;pauseScan&amp;#39;)
        self.pauseScan.clicked.connect(self.pausePressed) 

        self.show()

        def startPressed(self):
                global pauseScan
                pauseScan = False 
                dosomething()

        def pausePressed(self):
                global pauseScan
                pausScan = True

def dosomething(): 
    while pauseScan == False:
        print(&amp;#39;Running&amp;#39;) 
        time.sleep(4) 

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

688,,learnpython,"Hello,

I've recently made some DB backup scripts using pyodbc, where 5 or 6 databases are all backed up and then are compressed into a single dated .zip file using `shutil.makearchive`. Everything works as expected however it take 4-5 hrs for the compression of the SQL backups to complete. The files vary in size but the total is around 40 - 50 GB uncompressed, after compression they get down to about 2 GB give or take.

So, I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with compression operations with Python or any recommendations on better methods to use? I'm in the process now of testing out using Zipfile in place of shutil to see if that helps. The previous method was a bat file that called the 7zip CLI app on the DB backups after they were created and it took around 3 hours or so to complete. Not sure if this is realistic but I'd love to get this down to 1 - 2 hours. FWIW this script will be running on a pretty powerful server with 8 vCPUs and 32 GB RAM.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - after switching to using Zipfile, with the default compression settings, the compression time for 40 GB was a little over 13 minutes, while the size of the outputted zip file went from 2 GB to 4 GB. So far this seems like good trade off, especially since the zipped files are offloaded to S3. Still looking into other options.

&lt;p&gt;I have a working solution but it feels &amp;quot;excessive&amp;quot;. The function itself is pretty straightforward but my program which calls it  seems bloated (eg. using two while loops plus an if to get the output required).&lt;/p&gt;

Hello fellow redditors, i am quite the beginner at python but I kinda need it for its efficiency at parsing large log files, as i'm currently trying to analyse firewall logs.

I have coded one or two log parsers before but they were always normalised and these firewall logs (Stormshield) i'm onto now are giving me quite the headache :

* There is no defined separator in each line (it's a space, but some of my log variables do contain spaces too
* The content of the line is not always the same

Here's a sample from a line :

My problem is when I split each line on the variable separator that is a space (to get a list of value for each line) I also split the variables that do contain spaces.

What's the clever solution there ?

* parsing each line char by char to substitute the separator spaces to a comma ?
* writing a negative lookahead RegeX ?

&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow redditors, i am quite the beginner at python but I kinda need it for its efficiency at parsing large log files, as i&amp;#39;m currently trying to analyse firewall logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have coded one or two log parsers before but they were always normalised and these firewall logs (Stormshield) i&amp;#39;m onto now are giving me quite the headache :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no defined separator in each line (it&amp;#39;s a space, but some of my log variables do contain spaces too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content of the line is not always the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a sample from a line :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I have a hard time finding the right information (probably because I don't know the proper technical terms for what I am trying to do).

So my data are individual items that have type and many values. There are 0-n per type per day. So it looks like this:

```
            type    value_1 ... value_n
2020-01-01  A       5.5         ...

2020-01-05  B       6.0         ...
...
```

Now what I want is a summary that includes all the days and all the types:

```
            type    value_1_sum ... value_n_sum

...

```

I have found out how to use groupby.

```
tagessummen = df.groupby([""df_date"", ""type""]).agg(
    {""value_1"": ""sum"",
     ""value_2"": ""sum"",
     ""value_3"": ""sum""}

```

However this will just ignore the data categories that don't have data (i.e. in the above example it would hide 2020-01-01-B as well as 2020-01-02,03,04 entirely) - but I want those ""zero""-lines.

Also, I am trying to output to Excel (using openpyxl). I used this function before, but it seems it does not work with multi-column index:

```

I've just started ATBSWP, and I'm doing the questions at the end of the second chapter.  One question asks:

&gt;13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

I thought I'd try and put them in one program instead of 2.  [Git gist is here](https://gist.github.com/Elmlea/3d9f8f002a9d43cd9c4e41e63e6b7fba).  I ask the user for input, using a while loop to keep asking until there's a recognised answer (for or while, for the type of loop).

If the user puts in nonsense, it skips to the ""else"" clause like I expect, prints the term on line 25, then rolls back to the start of the initial while loop (line 5), and asks for a new input.

If the user puts in ""for,"" it executes the first 'if' statement, prints the numbers and terminates.

If the user puts in ""while,"" it executes the 'elif' statement, but then rolls back to line 5 and restarts, instead of terminating.

I don't understand why it restarts, and figured it must be something simple at this stage.

I have a bit of a weird one today.

I have an API token call as part of a wider API program i run daily.

This morning it failed, and when pulling the code apart found something weird.

The code itself is simple: I call the API, get a JSON response back with the token, open a CSV file, write the token to cell A1: Job Done.

Here's where it gets odd, it does all of the above just like normal. But when i test the token with a simple call, it tells me the token is no good and needs to be updated, BUT if i copy the whole token string from the JSON file and paste it into the CSV file by hand, it works perfectly. Even weirder, when if i compare the 2 strings, they are identical, BUT excel will not mark them as duplicates in conditional formatting.

I figured it was some sort of encoding issue, but its output and input is formatted to UTF-8 as far as im aware!

Below is the code for token and testing if it helps at all....but yeah just odd! Would appreciate some insights!

Of course, I can't solve many (if any) of the easy questions, and those I can get close to solving won't accept my brute-force solutions for some reason or another. I'm at this point where I am copy/pasting or YouTube searching the solutions to these problems and reverse engineering them for my purposes.

My problem is I don't learn by beating my head against a problem until it ""clicks"". I've never experienced this mythical ""click"" people say happens when you learn something, regardless of the hobby. I just don't learn like that, it's always been through imitation and pattern recognition.

So my question is: How do I break through this barrier in my learning? I feel like I'm on the brink of really understanding what I'm doing, between data structures and libraries and algorithms, but it seems everyone just teaches what these concepts are and not how they go together to actually make stuff and solve problems.

I am working on detecting abrupt change in my time series and if there is peak spike or drop in the trend. Also the data in multivariate and i want to detect if the changes are in all of them or just one of them and on the base of that i want to page my ops people. Data looks like below which i am structuring minute by minute as the volume and velocity is really high.

Time

&amp;#x200B;

Current work :- I am calculating z score and comparing it with historical data and it the trend is same then i am not paging else i am paging for any z score above 4.

Can any body give me a little direction and if possible if somebody having any similar work. even if you are having something for uni variate data that will also be helpful :-

I'm trying to send a SOAP request which sends a compressed XML file as Base64Binary using the python lib Zeep.

I started by trying the request using the client SOAPUI. This worked successfully by reading the compressed file in ipython, encoding it to base64 then **printing** it to the terminal (so the \\n characters are evaluated) and then copying the result into the SOAP request.

However when I try and send the request via Zeep with the encoded content as part of an args dict, it fails as the content is not parsed properly at their end, I'm assuming because the new line characters aren't evaluated properly.

No matter what I do, VSCode seems incapable of finding poetry interpreters in 'Python: Select Interpreter' command palette.

To fix this, I manually modified .vscode/settings.json to select poetry virtualenv interpreter. like:

`""python.pythonPath"": ""C:\\Users\\myusername\\AppData\\Local\\pypoetry\\Cache\\virtualenvs\\myprojectname-58e2e1Bc-py3.7\\Scripts\\python.exe"",`

Now that the interpreter is manually pinned, VSCode correctly recognize the interpreter.

However, I'm still not sure whether this is essentially the same as selecting an interpreter ""normally"" from the command palette. Is there any difference?

I want to add an additional column named `payout`. The `payout` should be 0 unless the sum of `actual`, month to date has passed the sum of `predicted`.

I.e., for `Nir`, we can see the sum of `predicted` is `4200`. So the `payout` should be 0 until the sum of `actual` passes 4200. Once that threshold is passed, then the `payout` should be 1% of `actual-predicted`. With the above data, the output would look like this:

    +------+-----+-----------+--------+---------------+--------+------------+

In the above output, `Xyc` has a total predicted 2000, so `payout` should be 0 until the sum of `actual` passes 2000 also. In the real dataframe, there is daily data for ~70 `name`s, so I feel like a grouping may be needed.

---------

I've tried:

    new_sum = [df.actual.values[0]] for i in range(1, len(df.index)): 
        new_sum.append(new_sum[i-1]+df.actual.values[i]) 
    df['actual_sum'] = new_sum 

However, that simply gave me a running total of `actual`. I also tried this:

    df['inc'] = df['actual'] - df['predicted'] df['payout'] = np.where(df['inc']&gt;=1, (df['inc'] / 100) * 1, 0) 

But the above doesn't make sure the month to date &gt;= total for the month before attributing the 1%.",t2_ubxk0,False,,0,False,Compare Running Total to Total for Month w/ Pandas and Numpy,[],r/learnpython,False,6,,0,False,t3_esqxcn,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579802000.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnpython,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a dataframe (&lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;).

As each day passes in the year, &lt;code&gt;actual&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; data is added to the row. There are multiple names for each day&lt;/p&gt;

    new_sum.append(new_sum[i-1]+df.actual.values[i]) 
df[&amp;#39;actual_sum&amp;#39;] = new_sum 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that simply gave me a running total of &lt;code&gt;actual&lt;/code&gt;. I also tried this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;df[&amp;#39;inc&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;actual&amp;#39;] - df[&amp;#39;predicted&amp;#39;] df[&amp;#39;payout&amp;#39;] = np.where(df[&amp;#39;inc&amp;#39;]&amp;gt;=1, (df[&amp;#39;inc&amp;#39;] / 100) * 1, 0) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the above doesn&amp;#39;t make sure the month to date &amp;gt;= total for the month before attributing the 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

If there is a marking in a column for a particular student, that means the student has that attribute (e.g. Jane Smith is honest and kind), whereas an empty cell means the student does not have that attribute. ""j"" was used because it was easy to type. The attribute columns are alphabetized.

The hump:

That initial stage when you're first learning where everything seems either way too simple to be of any use or way over your head so that you'll never comprehend it, so you feel stuck and unable to progress any further; then after some time you start to question how you managed to make it this far in life while being this stupid. Your brain labors to wrap itself around the understanding of these patterns and concepts that you know are simple logic, yet they elude your comprehension anyway, leading to tears of frustration and self deprecation. ""I guess I'll just work Helpdesk my whole life"", you start to think. Hey at least it's a job. You look at others' solutions to the practice projects/problems and you think ""of course, that was so obvious. I'd have figured it out if I wasn't an idiot.""

Then, finally, after several weeks or months or maybe even years, for some random reason or perhaps no reason at all, something clicks in your brain you finally start to ""get it"". 

I first started trying to even have any semblance of learning to code like 3-4 years ago. Started with the free Code Academy Python course and bounced around to a bunch of different courses and books. Lots of ragequitting, lots of being busy with the working father &amp; husband life, lots of just procrastination quitting and gaming instead. Lots of feeling stupid for not being able to think in simple logic. 

But FINALLY, after trying to study and learn on the side here and there, after starting and restarting Automate the Boring Stuff like 3-4 times, I'm getting to the point where I can actually figure out the Practice Projects at the end of the chapters without having to go look up someone else's GitHub to get a solution. Obviously I still have quite a long way to go, but I'm *finally* starting to get over hump. Maybe I'm not retarded after all *sniff* 

So if you're also stuck trying to get over the hump, just keep going and keep trying. It'll click eventually. Even if it takes a while. I know that sounds oversimplified and unhelpful but that's the same advice I got and I've found it to be true. 

My current plan is to (finally) complete ATBS, then go through ATBS 2nd Edition just to see what new stuff is in there, then go on to complete CS50 via edX, and then I've got an Android development course on Udemy I bought a while back that maybe I can finally start on, and then from there, I don't know. I'm open to suggestions :) I'm trying to get to the point where I can actually work as a developer and get out of Helpdesk support, and maybe develop my own Android app(s) on the side.

But anyway, tl;dr: Keep going :)

EDIT: looks like someone posted the new MIT edX course so I hope I can complete that as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/esdgks/free_mitx_course_starts_today_jan_22_2019_on_edx",t2_322wxeel,False,,0,False,"Finally getting over ""the hump"" is such a great feeling",[],r/learnpython,False,6,,0,False,t3_es593y,False,dark,,public,431,0,{},2398f596-b06d-11e3-9376-12313b0e88c2,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,431,,True,,1579719994.0,py32bg,[],{},,True,,1579688129.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnpython,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting this hopefully as an encouragement for others who are struggling learning this stuff to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

I am trying to make a series of three heatmap subplots with imshow, only the last one should have a colorbar. The code looks something like this:

    ax = plt.subplot(1,3,1)

My problem is with the alignment. If I don't make the plot wide enough, the third subplot becomes smaller than the others because the colorbar takes up some of the width. Even if I do make it wide enough, there is more space between the first and the second plot than between the second and the third, which looks ugly.

It seems to me that the third plot should be allowed to be wider than the others to keep the proportions normal, because it has a colorbar.

Does anyone know a solution for this?

Many thanks!

830,,learnpython,"Hey guys,

it's the first time I really write big piece of software. It has a gui, which I build using GTK and Glade (using the builder). The Gui class call another class called Logic, which handles the software-core in the background. The gui gets button clicks, entr values and so on, and calls the logic methods. so far so good.

Now I add more and more buttons, fields and functions to the gui class. It's too big to handle, so I figured I need to break it further down.

How is this done right? My first though was that I should create more classes, which get called with a reference to the main window, but only hold a small group of elements (say control elements for gui-function-a, and so on). But I can already imagine that ther will be problems:

It's not easy to isolate the functions from each, because in the end, everything works together, and how would I communicate between the subclasses? Lets say I would build subclass buttons, which would handle all button clicks. How would it know all siblign classes?

So at the moment I have one big Gui class which holds all callback functions, all formatting function, all the widget initialisation, and so on.

Do you guys have to tips for me?

This is what I submitted;

&gt;Hi!  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, this solution does not pass the tests. Try two\_fer()and you'll see what I mean.  
&gt;  
&gt;Python accepts default arguments for its functions. You should try that and see how it makes your function simpler.

I reworked the program to which I ended up with;

    def two_fer(name=None):

Hello!

I'm starting to learn how to code in python and I have a problem right now where I am building a program to find the hertz of a given octave.

The requirements for this project state that I must ask for the octave and the pitch class separately and then combine them together

ex.

octave = 9

pitch class = 2

I need python to combine these to ""9.2""

right now I have each int  being changed to a float, but there is a step that I'm missing.

I think I need to concatenate the two but I'm not sure how to combine them. I've looked all over google and I'm stuck. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to send a PIL Image object to a discord chat (I don&amp;#39;t want to save the file though) I have a function that gathers images from the internet, joins them together vertically and then return a PIL Image object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code below creates a file image from the PIL Image object on my local machine and then sends it to a Discord chat. I don&amp;#39;t want to constantly be recreating and saving the file image on my machine. How can I just send the PIL Image object instead of having to save the image every time I send a request?&lt;/p&gt;

    im = []
    for index in indexes:

    dst = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (im[0].width, im[0].height + im[1].height + im[2].height))
    dst.paste(im[0], (0, 0))
    dst.paste(im[1], (0, im[0].height))
    dst.paste(im[2], (0, im[0].height + im[1].height))

    return dst

so it is impossible to hard code it. How can I do this?

There was a typo

&lt;p&gt;The problem is the list &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; will contain more than 20 items and the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; will be greater than 100,
And also there will be repetition that I don&amp;#39;t want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current output:
```

&lt;h2&gt;1=457, 2=578, 3=269, 4=799&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2=457, 3=578, 4=269, 5=799

I'm beginning to understand list comprehension and I'm fairly certain my code for that isn't the problem. I iterate through a list of commands like this:
`if cmd in [names for function,names in self.command_list]:`

*The command_list object is defined like so:...*
`self.command_list = []`
*When ever a new command is added:...*
`self.command_list.append(self.function)`
`self.command_list.append(self.names)`

I can't see why this would try iterating over the function in someway. Is there something I'm missing? I'm a hundred percent sure that my list can't be the problem as I've already checked it after the functions added.

This is my first time here.

I'm working on an assignment for school, where I have to write an image-sharpening method that takes a color gif image, and sharpen the edges. I have done searches online for how this might be done, but I usually get references to importing some image-filtering model (which I can't do), or I get a lot of information on the science of image-sharpening that goes over my head.

I don't want anyone doing my work for me; but I'm so lost and tangled at this point that a clue would be greatly appreciated. I've already emailed my professor twice, so I'm still waiting some feedback from him.

Firstly, I'm working with Cengage's Mindtap; the textbook is Kenneth A. Lambert's ""Fundamentals of Python: First Programs"", 2nd edition.

In the textbook, Chapter 7: Simple Graphics and Image Processing, we are given a cursory overview of image processing in Python. The author uses his own images.py module as a basis for getting images, saving images, and basic functions, such as getting the image's width, height, and color of current pixel. The module is limited to working with GIF images.

The particular problem I am having is with Programming Exercise 10:

""The edge-detection function described in this chapter returns a black-and-white image. Think of a similar way to transform color values so that the new image is still in its original colors but the outlines within in are merely sharpened. Then, define a function named sharpen that performs this operation. The function should expect an image and two integers as arguments. One integer should represent the degree to which the image should be sharpened. The other integer should represent the threshold used to detect edges. (Hint: A pixel can be darkened by making its RGB values smaller.""

The header for the function looks like so (followed by a stub for the body:

def sharpen(image, degree, threshold):

""""""""Code goes here """"""

    return imageCopy	

""imageCopy"" above refers to a copy of the input image. All transformations are performed on the copy of the image.

Alright, based on the above description of how the program should work, I analyzed the edge-detection function in the textbook. It basically gets the average value of a single pixel's RGB color \[(R + G + B) / 3\]. It compares this average to the average of the pixel below the current pixel, and to the left. If the difference of the averages is greater than some threshold value, an edge has been detected. In this case, it shades the current pixel black. If the difference of averages is less than the threshold, it sets the current pixel to white.

My approach was to adopt this edge-detection, so that when an edge was detected, rather than set the pixel to black or white, it needs to be set to a color. This is one area I'm stuck in. Obviously, I can't just use the original colors, because then the output is just the original image with no sharpening. Further, I have to figure out how to use the degree (one of the arguments to the function) to make the change.

I've tried subtracting the degree from the current R, G, B values such that: (R - degree, G - degree, B - degree). This appears to result often times in colors that the Image object can't parse; when I'm told a color can't be parsed, it's usually given as a hexadecimal number, or as an odd formatting such as #-200-8. \[That's not an exact number, but the kind of format I'll get.\]

I've tried stepping through the RGB values for the pixel, so that if subtracting the degree causes a value less than 0, the value will be set to 0. This usually results in an error specifying the image can't be saved due to ""too many colors"", which I presume means I'm out of the 256-color limit of GIF; I guess I end up with more than 256 colors, somehow.

I looked online to better understand what it means to ""sharpen"" an image. One result was that sharpening an images increases contrast between pixels. I have tried adding the degree to the current pixel, as described above; substracting the degree from the pixel's neighbor to the left or below. This all results in unparsable colors or unsavable images due to ""too many colors"".

Finally, I substracted the degree from the threshold, thinking that the threshold finds the edge, and subtracting the degree from it will somehow ""sharpen"" the edge. This is not quite it either. The feedback from Mindtap claims the image is sharpened, but the results are not what it's looking for. I know the image is not sharpened, because as a test, I simply set the RGB values to their original values, without any change.

I can tell at this point, that I'm just making up solutions as I go along. I'm going in a lot of circles, but getting no closer to my destination. And, my work is due tonight, so I feel extra-compelled to reach out for help.

It's clear to me that I am missing some vital information. For instance, I'm not even sure if degree is measuring pixel position, or color. If the threshold is the difference between average color values of neighboring values, then what exactly is degree? I've tried using degree as a value to darken pixels (because of the hint about darkening pixels), to darken and lighten pixels (to increase contrast between neighboring pixels), and finally, to substract it from the threshold under the (probably faulty) presumption that doing so will somehow make narrower edges. But, I'm sure even if this was so, that I'm am doing it wrong.

Here is the [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/jyTWXHAW)  of the code as it currently stands. Right now, it only subtracts the degree from the threshold, but just assigns the current color values back to the image.

Here is an earlier [version](https://pastebin.com/5ARCcqfS) that also does not work, although it does process the image. The idea here was to increase ""sharpness"" by increasing contrast between pixels. I know this can't be right, based on the result.

To avoid spamming this forum I'm just posting the code in its current format and one older version for comparison.  I have several other versions on my computer if it would be helpful for anyone else to see.

The author's own images.py module can be found on his Website ,[here](http://kennethalambert.com/python/cs1pythonv2/index.html). It is required for the sharpen.py module to work.

&lt;p&gt;The particular problem I am having is with Programming Exercise 10:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The edge-detection function described in this chapter returns a black-and-white image. Think of a similar way to transform color values so that the new image is still in its original colors but the outlines within in are merely sharpened. Then, define a function named sharpen that performs this operation. The function should expect an image and two integers as arguments. One integer should represent the degree to which the image should be sharpened. The other integer should represent the threshold used to detect edges. (Hint: A pixel can be darkened by making its RGB values smaller.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The header for the function looks like so (followed by a stub for the body:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def sharpen(image, degree, threshold):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Code goes here &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;return imageCopy    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;imageCopy&amp;quot; above refers to a copy of the input image. All transformations are performed on the copy of the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, based on the above description of how the program should work, I analyzed the edge-detection function in the textbook. It basically gets the average value of a single pixel&amp;#39;s RGB color [(R + G + B) / 3]. It compares this average to the average of the pixel below the current pixel, and to the left. If the difference of the averages is greater than some threshold value, an edge has been detected. In this case, it shades the current pixel black. If the difference of averages is less than the threshold, it sets the current pixel to white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach was to adopt this edge-detection, so that when an edge was detected, rather than set the pixel to black or white, it needs to be set to a color. This is one area I&amp;#39;m stuck in. Obviously, I can&amp;#39;t just use the original colors, because then the output is just the original image with no sharpening. Further, I have to figure out how to use the degree (one of the arguments to the function) to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried subtracting the degree from the current R, G, B values such that: (R - degree, G - degree, B - degree). This appears to result often times in colors that the Image object can&amp;#39;t parse; when I&amp;#39;m told a color can&amp;#39;t be parsed, it&amp;#39;s usually given as a hexadecimal number, or as an odd formatting such as #-200-8. [That&amp;#39;s not an exact number, but the kind of format I&amp;#39;ll get.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried stepping through the RGB values for the pixel, so that if subtracting the degree causes a value less than 0, the value will be set to 0. This usually results in an error specifying the image can&amp;#39;t be saved due to &amp;quot;too many colors&amp;quot;, which I presume means I&amp;#39;m out of the 256-color limit of GIF; I guess I end up with more than 256 colors, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked online to better understand what it means to &amp;quot;sharpen&amp;quot; an image. One result was that sharpening an images increases contrast between pixels. I have tried adding the degree to the current pixel, as described above; substracting the degree from the pixel&amp;#39;s neighbor to the left or below. This all results in unparsable colors or unsavable images due to &amp;quot;too many colors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I substracted the degree from the threshold, thinking that the threshold finds the edge, and subtracting the degree from it will somehow &amp;quot;sharpen&amp;quot; the edge. This is not quite it either. The feedback from Mindtap claims the image is sharpened, but the results are not what it&amp;#39;s looking for. I know the image is not sharpened, because as a test, I simply set the RGB values to their original values, without any change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell at this point, that I&amp;#39;m just making up solutions as I go along. I&amp;#39;m going in a lot of circles, but getting no closer to my destination. And, my work is due tonight, so I feel extra-compelled to reach out for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear to me that I am missing some vital information. For instance, I&amp;#39;m not even sure if degree is measuring pixel position, or color. If the threshold is the difference between average color values of neighboring values, then what exactly is degree? I&amp;#39;ve tried using degree as a value to darken pixels (because of the hint about darkening pixels), to darken and lighten pixels (to increase contrast between neighboring pixels), and finally, to substract it from the threshold under the (probably faulty) presumption that doing so will somehow make narrower edges. But, I&amp;#39;m sure even if this was so, that I&amp;#39;m am doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=""https://pastebin.com/jyTWXHAW""&gt;pastebin&lt;/a&gt;  of the code as it currently stands. Right now, it only subtracts the degree from the threshold, but just assigns the current color values back to the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an earlier &lt;a href=""https://pastebin.com/5ARCcqfS""&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; that also does not work, although it does process the image. The idea here was to increase &amp;quot;sharpness&amp;quot; by increasing contrast between pixels. I know this can&amp;#39;t be right, based on the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid spamming this forum I&amp;#39;m just posting the code in its current format and one older version for comparison.  I have several other versions on my computer if it would be helpful for anyone else to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author&amp;#39;s own images.py module can be found on his Website ,&lt;a href=""http://kennethalambert.com/python/cs1pythonv2/index.html""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is required for the sharpen.py module to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I modified df2's 'name' column to follow the (first initial, last name convention) of df1's 'short\_name' column. Unfortunately it led to many exceptions since df2's 'name' column doesn't always follow that convention (examples include, 'Neymar Jr' (expected: ""Neymar""), Cristiano Ronaldo (expected: C. Ronaldo), and Roberto Firmino (expected: R. Firmino).

The only other thing I can think of is using substring matching.

Is there a way to split df2's 'name' column into separate substrings and then see if df1's 'long\_name' contains all of those elements (ie seeing if ""Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini"" has both ""Lionel"" and  ""Messi"" from d1's name and then merging on it)?

After searching for a while, it doesn't seem like something in pandas functionality since it splits it into several columns. I also don't know if merges can take conditions like substring matches.

Everything I've thought of doesn't address these exceptions/non-matches except for substring matching. If there are any other ideas out there I would love to know. It's been a few days and I can't seem to get this.

Edit: Thanks to another user in r/learnprogramming, I was able to find something that works which required isolating and creating a copy of the columns (making them series) then splitting the names into lists and seeing if the shorter names were subsets of the longer names in a double for-loop. Here is my code:

    names = df1['name']
    long_names = df2['long_name']

    for i in range(len(names)):
        name_list = names[i].split()
        for j in range(len(long_names)):

&lt;p&gt;I modified df2&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;name&amp;#39; column to follow the (first initial, last name convention) of df1&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;short_name&amp;#39; column. Unfortunately it led to many exceptions since df2&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;name&amp;#39; column doesn&amp;#39;t always follow that convention (examples include, &amp;#39;Neymar Jr&amp;#39; (expected: &amp;quot;Neymar&amp;quot;), Cristiano Ronaldo (expected: C. Ronaldo), and Roberto Firmino (expected: R. Firmino).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other thing I can think of is using substring matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to split df2&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;name&amp;#39; column into separate substrings and then see if df1&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;long_name&amp;#39; contains all of those elements (ie seeing if &amp;quot;Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini&amp;quot; has both &amp;quot;Lionel&amp;quot; and  &amp;quot;Messi&amp;quot; from d1&amp;#39;s name and then merging on it)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for a while, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like something in pandas functionality since it splits it into several columns. I also don&amp;#39;t know if merges can take conditions like substring matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I&amp;#39;ve thought of doesn&amp;#39;t address these exceptions/non-matches except for substring matching. If there are any other ideas out there I would love to know. It&amp;#39;s been a few days and I can&amp;#39;t seem to get this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks to another user in &lt;a href=""/r/learnprogramming""&gt;r/learnprogramming&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to find something that works which required isolating and creating a copy of the columns (making them series) then splitting the names into lists and seeing if the shorter names were subsets of the longer names in a double for-loop. Here is my code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;names = df1[&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;]
long_names = df2[&amp;#39;long_name&amp;#39;]

for i in range(len(names)):
    name_list = names[i].split()
    for j in range(len(long_names)):
        long_name_list = long_names[j].split()
        if set(name_list).issubset(long_name_list):
            df2.loc[j, &amp;quot;long_name&amp;quot;] = df1.loc[i, &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

example:

i have this 8 words in a list

\['song', 'most', 'broadly', 'is', 'a', 'work', 'music', 'typically'\]

&amp;#x200B;

user entered 11

than python will iterate:

the loop will go 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &gt;&gt; **than will go back to index zero** (11 - 8 steps) &gt;&gt; 0 1 2

so it will print 'broadly'

899,,learnpython,"I posted in the ""Ask Anything Monday"" thread a problem I was having with a program. The basic issue was as follows (edited for brevity):

    df = pd.read_csv('file path', na_values = '') 
    cl_c = df.CR.quantile([0.25]) 
    df.loc[df['CR'] &lt; cl_c, 'Cluster'] = 'D' 
    df.loc[df['CR'] &gt;= cl_c, 'Cluster'] = 'C' 

So the issue I was encountering is that I wanted cl\_c to be a float64, and then use the information in cl\_c to append a new column to my dataframe that would assign a letter code to each row based on the CR column.

I felt that cl\_c should become a float based on the calculation done in df.CR.quantile. 

Now, if this had been in Excel, I could set a cell - say A1 - to something like:

    =quartile.inc(B1:B100,1)

Then I could use the value there against a table to do something like:

    =IF(F1&gt;=A1,""A"",""D"") 

And voila, done.  So that was the mind set I was in when I attempted to build this out. However, the .quantile approach was turning cl\_c into a dataframe itself. 

So I had the right data, but it was in a dataframe NOT as an independent variable that I could use in other calculations. Thus, when I told the computer to compare the CR value to the cl\_c value, I was basically saying ""Compare one float against this whole dataframe"" and my computer was rightly confused.

So I had to change it up. I had the data, I just needed to point to it!

    df = pd.read_csv('file path', na_values = '') 
    cl_c = df.CR.quantile([0.25]) 
    df.loc[df['CR'] &lt; cl_c.at[0.25], 'Cluster'] = 'D' 
    df.loc[df['CR'] &gt;= cl_c.at[0.25], 'Cluster'] = 'C' 

And voila! It worked! So how did I figure it out?

1. I knew that the sorting part (df.loc) was working because I could just type the numbers in after the &gt;= sign and it would sort. I had to fix the order to make it go lower to higher, but that was easy.
2. So since I could read the dataframe, and I could make adjustments to the dataframe, that isolated out the problem. It had to be with my cl\_c variable.
3. Since it wasn't working like I had intended, I wanted to know why. so I tested data types. First, I looked at df.CR.dtype and saw that it was a float64 (which is what I wanted, I was concerned it had come in as a string). So that was okay.
4. So then I did the same with my cl\_c and that's when I saw it was returning NOT as a float64, but as a &lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt; 
5. When I printed cl\_c it showed up as: 0.25     0.388
6. Now, I have no idea what the hell this means so I went here:  [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html)  \- now I barely understand anything on here, but I'm really only looking for one thing - How do I get my data OUT of this?
7. Going through I found the ""at"" thing. At first I tried doing ""at\[1\]"" because I was thinking this was like a list right, so you have 0 for the first position and 1 for the next position. This didn't work.
8. So then I realized maybe the 0.25 was the name - because I called it as 0.25. So it was telling me, ""Yo, stupid, you asked for first quantile and this is the first quantile"". 
9. So I set it to be cl\_c.at\[0.25\] and it worked!
10. As a note, I had three CL variables: cl\_c, cl\_b, cl\_a for \[0.25\], \[0.5\], and \[0.75\] respectively. I now have one cluster variable that calls all three and then I just use the at symbol on the three points in the data frame. So now it looks like [`cluster.at`](https://cluster.at)`[0.25],` [`cluster.at`](https://cluster.at)`[0.5], cluster.at[0.75]`

Only answer to questions that aren't correct in appendix C are mentioned, here are the right answers to them:

***Chapter 8***

Just before the header 'Project: Multiplication Quiz' there's a spanish version of the 'how to keep an idiot busy for hours' program with the line `if response == 'sí':` which should instead be `if response == 'no':`.

Practice Questions:

1. PyInputPlus does not come with the standard Python Library. It is a 3rd party module.
2. Typing pyip takes far less time to type than pyinputplus, especially if you often use functions from this module.
3. inputInt() only accepts integers as input and inputFloat() only accepts floats as input.
4. possible\_answer = pyip.inputInt('input number: ', min=0, max=99)
5. You pass regex to the allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments.
6. The program returns a pyinputplus.RetryLimitException error.
7. The function will return ‘hello’ by default after entering a blank input thrice.

***Chapter 9***

Right at the end of the code of the randomQuizGenerator.py program Al forgot to make a newline for every answer on the answer sheet. The code should be as follows:

            # Write the answer key to a file.
            answerKeyFile.write(f""{questionNum + 1}.{'ABCD'[answerOptions.index(correctAnswer)]}\n"")

&lt;li&gt;inputInt() only accepts integers as input and inputFloat() only accepts floats as input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;possible_answer = pyip.inputInt(&amp;#39;input number: &amp;#39;, min=0, max=99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You pass regex to the allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The program returns a pyinputplus.RetryLimitException error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function will return ‘hello’ by default after entering a blank input thrice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right at the end of the code of the randomQuizGenerator.py program Al forgot to make a newline for every answer on the answer sheet. The code should be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        # Write the answer key to a file.
        answerKeyFile.write(f&amp;quot;{questionNum + 1}.{&amp;#39;ABCD&amp;#39;[answerOptions.index(correctAnswer)]}\n&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ll ping Al Sweigart (the writer of the book) once I reach the end of the book and have a full collection of all the errors I found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: rewrote entire post as the entire appendix C hasn&amp;#39;t been updated for the second edition on &lt;a href=""http://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc""&gt;automatetheboringstuff.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The answer to chapter 7 - question 20 is correct in appendix C. The following was part of the original post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for question 20, the task is to match print [&amp;#39;42&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;1,234&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;6,368,745&amp;#39;]. I currently have this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;print(re.compile(r&amp;#39;^\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*$&amp;#39;).findall(r&amp;quot;42 1,234 6,368,745 12,34,567 1234&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it I&amp;#39;m doing wrong? I tried tinkering the regex, but can&amp;#39;t figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time ever I built a virtual environment for a new project I'm working on. If I check ""where python"" after activating the environment, I still see the path to my global installation of Python. Why is that? Is this correct? When I try running a script it throws an error that once refers to the global installation of Python and once to the local one within the virtual environment.

I tried setting up another venv, but the same thing seems to happen. Do I have to manually set the PATH variable to exclude local Python installations?

921,,learnpython,"Hey all! Having a little problem with a code here.  I'm writing an alarm clock program, piece by piece, as sort of a learning project, as each piece stretches my knowledge in a new way.

Right now I have 3 dictionaries set up that store information on which alarms are on, what time they should go off, and what sound they should play. When it's time for the alarm to go off, I have a thread pass the argument to the function that actually plays the music. I'm using threading so that I can have other functions operating while the music plays. A simplified version looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    import time
    import threading
    import playsound
    
    times = {""time1"":""7:00:00""}
    #time the alarm should go off
    
    alarm_on = {""alarm1"":""on""}
    #states that the alarm is on
    
    sounds = {""sound1"":r""c:\generic_filepath.mp3""}
    #tells the alarm which song to play
    
    def play_alarm(music):
        playsound.playsound(music)
        #this function sounds the alarm. I also have a snooze function not shown
    
    first_alarm = threading.Thread(target = play_alarm, args = sounds[""sound1""])
    #thread that plays the alarm
    
    def check_alarm():
        while True:
            if alarm_on[""alarm1""] == ""on"" and times[""time1""] == time.strftime(""%H:%M:%S""):
                first_alarm.start()
            else:
                time.sleep(1)
            #checks to see if the alarm is turned on, and if it's time to set it off
            #if yes to both, it starts the thread
    
    check_alarm()

This is obviously a bit simplified from the full version, but it gets the idea across. Anyway, the problem that I'm having is that when I run this code, I get:

    TypeError: play_alarm() takes 1 positional argument but 116 were given

I've looked at the documentation, but it seems very opaque to me. I've also searched online and can't find anything that looks like this in a thread. Can anyone help me understand what's going on here? Thanks!

The above is stripped a bit, my actual dataframe has daily data for all of 2020, with 60 ids per day. `inc` is a result of `actual` - `predicted` and `payout` is 1% of `inc`. Here is the logic for how I have handled this:

    df['inc'] = df['actual'] - df['predicted']    
    df['payout'] = np.where(df['inc']&gt;=1, (df['inc'] / 100) * 1, 0)

I want the `payout` column to be 1% of `inc` but only after the monthly sum of `predicted` is passed by the monthly sum of `actual`, otherwise the `payout` should be 0.

I.e. 25 days into January, the sum of `actual` passes the sum of `predicted` for all of January, from then on I want to count 1% of the difference. Anything before should be 0.

`predicted` has values until 2020-12-31, while `actual` only has data up until the current day and is NaN for future dates.

Here is how the output might look if the total `predicted` for January was 1000.

I am trying to perform [Hierarchical Agglormerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html) and in order to fit the model it requires an array be passed to it.

For example:`X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]])clustering = AgglomerativeClustering().fit(X)`

Scenario: I have network data associated to a port number and each port has associated data (array per port) which are all stored in an overall list. I am trying to cluster in comparison to each port (array).

Like the following example does:

However trying to cluster a list of arrays (each array with varying sizes) will not work. I cannot figure how I could possibly do it and was wondering if anyone could provide some advise. Thanks.

I have multiple dictionaries like this =

```
""12"" = {""Name"": ""Adams"", ""Age"": ""12"", ""Pet"": ""Dog""}
""13"" = {""Name"": ""Charlie"", ""Age"": ""38"", ""Hobby"": ""Magnets"", ""Food"": ""Milk Steak""}
```

How do I convert these information to CSV, where

- each dictionary represents a row
- The variable name being the first column, named ""ID""
- The ```key``` in the dictionary is a column itself
- Missing a key and value will still have the key but it will show something like ""N/A""
- Continuously run and append new dictionary to CSV

So what I want the CSV to look like this

| ID | Name    | Age | Pet | Hobby   | Food       |
|----|---------|-----|-----|---------|------------|
| 12 | Adams   | 12  | Dog | N/A     | N/A        |

When I run my GUI on a computer with 125% or 150% scaling, the font no longer fits within my label boxes, but the rest of the GUI elements are exactly as I set them. Is there a way to make the specific program run at 100% scaling, or somehow set the text to a fixed font size? (Like exactly x pixels high?) This program will be in a fixed window size, and only on 1080p displays so scaling text isn&amp;#39;t an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;

954,,learnpython," In **A** we have column named #type that contain objects like item1, item2 etc. each needs to become new column.

item1 have id, you can use it to find item2 with the same id, same goes for item3 and item4 (some may have missing data and have no entries for them but thats is rare, 0 can be put there)

So group items by ID, the date will be the same for all the entries with same ID. As for the value for the itemX use the result from A.

* Takes screenshots of both displays (only 2 supported at the moment)  
* You can select which Display to work on  
* You can Mirror vertically (make scene composition is better if mirrored)  
* You can Blur it (spam it even) to see if readability is good  
* You can ""spawn"" a rule of third grid  

&amp;#x200B;

**What I could have done differently/better:**

* Add a folder selection for where the screenshots will be saved  
* Add a slider for how strong the blur can be (instead of spamming the button)
* Draw on top of the image for grids instead of adding another image (even if currently its way faster (for development)
* Add the option to have dark or light theme instead of just dark.
* Scaling/Resizing the window would resize/scale the screenshot/ui too.
